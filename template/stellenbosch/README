DESCRIPTION
===========

The Stellenbosch bundle consists of the following:

 usthesis.cls/usthesis.sty (usthesis.afr, usthesis.eng):

     The usthesis class/style files are provided to typeset reports,
     theses and dissertations that conform to the requirements of
     the Engineering Faculty of the University of Stellenbosch.
         The class file usthesis.cls is based on the standard LaTeX
     book class, while usthesis.sty is a style file to be loaded on
     top of the very powerful memoir class. Both options give
     identical output, but the benefit of the using memoir is that
     it has many additional command and environments for formatting
     and processing of a document.
         Usthesis is primarily concerned with the formatting of the
     front matter such as the title page, abstract, etc. It also
     works together with the babel package to provide language
     language options to typeset documents in Afrikaans or in
     English.

 usbib.sty (usmeg-a.bst, usmeg-n.bst, ussagus.bst)

     USbib is a LaTeX and BibTeX package for the formatting of
     bibliographic references of theses and dissertations of the

     engineering.

     The ustitle package redefine the standard title page of the
     LaTeX classes to add a logo at the top and an address line

 usnomencl.sty
