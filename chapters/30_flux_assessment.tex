\chapter{Autophagic flux assessment}
\section{Introduction}

Autophagy is a physiological cellular process that is characterized by a fine balance between the rate of AV formation and the rate of their clearance, with autophagic flux referring  to the rate of flow of material through the autophagic pathway \citep{loos2014,klionsky2016}. Many tools and techniques are available to assess autophagy, including western blotting (WB), fluorescence microscopy (FM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), flow cytometry \citep{klionsky2016} and Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM) with each technique having particular advantages, but also inherent disadvantages.

Autophagy plays a significant role in health where primarily decreased activation of autophagy has been shown to have detrimental effects. Autophagy can be induced via mTOR dependent and mTOR independent pathways \citep{sarkar2013}. Although we have progressed substantially in the understanding of the autophagy machinery and its regulation, its dysfunction in pathology as well as its dynamic changes however in the disease progression remains often largely unclear. Furthermore, although a substantial progress has been made in unravelling the role and regulation of autophagy and its modulation in neurodegenerative disease using pharmacological agents, major differences exist between experimental design, drug concentrations used, duration of treatment intervention as well as the model system used to assess autophagic flux \citep{lumkwana2017}. This contributes to inability to modulate autophagy with high precision. Specifically, spermidine and rilmenidine have been shown to induce autophagy, but the impact of concentration ranges on autophagic flux and on subsequent protein clearance and neuronal toxicity is unclear. Importantly, whether a concentration dependent effect on autophagy activity exists achieving defined, but distinguishable heightened autophagy flux remains unclear. Particularly in terms of fine-tuning autophagy activity with a given flux deviation in neurodegeneration, this aspect is of critical importance. In this chapter we firstly aimed to establish a suitable concentration of spermidine (Spd) and rilmenidine (Ril) using GT 1-7 neuronal cells that induces autophagic flux without causing cellular toxicity, and secondly, to characterize the autophagic flux profile of a low and high concentration of both drugs established in terms of (1) the autophagic machinery and pathway intermediates (autophagosomes, autolysosome),(2) the autophagosome flux, (3) p62 puncta, and (4) autophagic vacuoles (AVs). For this purpose, GT1-7 neuronal cells were treated with three concentrations of Spd and Ril in the presence and absence of BafA1. Subsequently, cellular viability and WB for LC3 II and p62 was performed. Next, to assess the effect of a low and high concentration of Spd and Ril, GT 1-7 cells were treated with 1 \& {10 $\mu$M respectively in the presence and absence of BafA1 and thereafter extensively analysed using FM and TEM linked to quantitative morphometric analysis. In addition, GT1-7 cells were transfected with mRFP-GFP-LC3 \citep{yoshii2017} and subsequently treated with 1 \& 10 $\mu$M of Spd and Ril in the presence and absence of BafA1 and analysed with FM.
 
\section{Effect of spermidine and rilmenidine on cell viability}
In order to choose a suitable, yet non-toxic concentration of autophagy modulators, WST-1 was performed. For the concentrations assessed, no decrease in viability was observed. In fact, a minor metabolic response associated with enhanced reductive capacity was observed. Reductive capacity was significantly increased using 1 $\mu$M Spd 104.70 \% $\pm$ 1.64 \%, \textit{p} < 0.05 and 10 $\mu$M Spd (109.20 $\pm$ 1.38 \%, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control (100.00 \% $\pm$ 1.50 \%), with no significant differences observed using 0.1 $\mu$M Spd (104.20 \% $\pm$ 1.46 \%) (\Cref{fig:30_spd_cell_viability}: \textbf{A}). More importantly, a significant increase in reductive capacity was observed with 10 $\mu$M Spd (\textit{p} < 0.01) compared to 0.1 $\mu$M Spd and 1 $\mu$M Spd.

Following rilmenidine treatment, a significant increase in reductive capacity was observed in the 10 $\mu$M Ril treated group (105.70 $\pm$ 2.26 \%, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control (100.40 $\pm$ 1.16 \%), with no significant differences observed in the 0.1 $\mu$M Ril (98.76 \% $\pm$ 1.49 \%) and 1 $\mu$M Ril (100.50 $\pm$ 2.12 \%) (\Cref{fig:30_spd_cell_viability}: \textbf{B}). Importantly, a significant increase in cellular viability was observed in the 10 $\mu$M Ril group compared to 0.1 $\mu$M and 1 $\mu$M Ril. This data suggests no toxicity and allowed to choose a low and high concentration of spermidine and rilmenidine for subsequent experiments.

\section{Effect of spermidine and rilmenidine on autophagic flux using western blotting}
To further identify the concentration that would have maximal autophagy inducing effects, protein extraction was performed following 8 hr treatment with a range of Spd and Ril concentrations. Western blot analysis was performed to assess the protein expression of LC3-II and p62. LC3 II is formed through conjugation of LC3-I to PE and is localized on the inner and outer surface of the autophagosome membrane, where it is either degraded upon fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes or removed through deconjugation and recycled \citep{kabeya2000}. Importantly, the abundance of LC3 II correlates with the number of autophagosomes and hence is used as a key marker to indicate autophagy or the size of the autophagosome pool \citep{loos2014} p62 serves as a scaffolding for ubiquitinated proteins \citep{sahani2014}. It binds directly to LC3 and is in turn selectively degraded through autophagy; thus it is widely used as an additional indicator for autophagy activity \citep{pankiv2007}.

\subsection{Abundance of LC3 II and p62}
A significant increase in the abundance of LC3 II was observed in the 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 (1.67 $\pm$ 0.28) compared to the control group (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00) (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_abun}: \textbf{A}\textit{i}, \textbf{A}\textit{iii}). Moreover, a significant increase in the abundance of LC3 II was observed in the 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 (\textit{p} < 0.05) compared to 0.1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1. No significant differences were observed between 0.1 $\mu$M Spd, 1 $\mu$M Spd and 10 $\mu$M Spd. A significant increase was observed in the 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to10 $\mu$M Spd, with no significant differences seen between 0.1 $\mu$M Spd and 0.1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 and between 1 $\mu$M Spd versus 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1, however it is important to mention that in both the 0.1 $\mu$M Spd  and 1 $\mu$M Spd, inhibition of degradation with BafA1 resulted in an increased LC3 II accumulation compared to the Baf untreated groups (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_abun}: \textbf{A}\textit{i}, \textbf{A}\textit{iii}), suggesting the presence of a basal as well as increased autophagic activity.

The abundance of p62 was significantly increased in the BafA1 treated group (1.72 $\pm$ 0.26, \textit{p} < 0.05) and  10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 (1.72 $\pm$ 0.17, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to Con (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00) (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_abun}: \textbf{A}\textit{ii}, \textbf{A}\textit{iii}). Moreover, in comparison to the Bafa1 treated group, a significant decrease in p62 abundance was observed in the 1 $\mu$M Spd, with no significant differences seen in all other groups. A higher abundance was indicated in the presence of BafA1 in all treatment groups compared to the respective BafA1 untreated groups (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_abun}: \textbf{A}\textit{i}, \textbf{A}\textit{iii}).

With regards to rilmenidine treatment (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_abun}: \textbf{B}\textit{i}, \textbf{B}\textit{iii}), no significant differences in the abundance of LC3 II were observed, however an increasing trend in the amount of LC3 II in the BafA1 treated groups compared to the BafA1 untreated groups was noted [Con (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00), BafA1 (1.45 $\pm$ 0.49), 0.1 $\mu$M (1.16 $\pm$ 0.09), 0.1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (1.46 $\pm$ 0.36), 1 $\mu$M Ril (0.94 $\pm$ 0.14), 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (1.22 $\pm$ 0.42), 10 $\mu$M Ril (1.02 $\pm$ 0.27) and 10 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (1.17 $\pm$ 0.63)].

A significant increase in p62 protein expression was observed in the 1 $\mu$M Ril (1.68 $\pm$ 0.19, \textit{p} < 0.05), 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (2.21 $\pm$ 0.31, \textit{p} < 0.05) and 10 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (1.81 $\pm$ 0.08, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the Con group (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00) (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_abun}: \textbf{B}\textit{ii}, \textbf{B}\textit{iii}). Moreover, a significant increase in p62 protein levels was revealed in the 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 compared to BafA1 treated group. Furthermore, a significant increase in p62 abundance was observed in the 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (\textit{p} < 0.05) compared to 0.1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1, with no significant differences observed when compared to 10 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1. Finally, overall p62 protein abundance accumulated in the BafA1 treated groups compared to the respective BafA1 untreated groups, however not reaching significance (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_abun}: \textbf{B}\textit{ii}, \textbf{B}\textit{iii}). No response was observed in 0.1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 compared to its BafA1 untreated group. This data suggests an autophagy enhancing effect, which is best revealed through the impacted p62 clearance.

\subsection{LC3 II and p62 protein turnover}
In order to better estimate autophagic flux, turnover of LC3 II was assessed. To estimate autophagic flux, it is necessary to determine the extent of change in the LC3 II protein abundance at a given time point in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors (i.e. BafA1) \citep{Martinez-Lopez2013}. Thus, mean values of the BafA1 treated groups (BafA1, 0.1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1, 1 $\mu$M Spd + Baf A1and 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1) were subtracted from the BafA1 untreated groups (control, 0.1 $\mu$M Spd, 1 $\mu$M Spd and 10 $\mu$M Spd), respectively.

  \label{fig:30_spd_ril_abun}

\end{landscape}

A significant increase in LC3-II protein turnover was observed using 10 $\mu$M Spd (0.91 $\pm$ 0.15, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control group (0.24 $\pm$ 0.11) as well as the 0.1 $\mu$M Spd (0.12 $\pm$ 0.09) and 1 $\mu$M Spd (0.26 $\pm$ 0.07), with no significant differences observed using 0.1 $\mu$M Spd  and 1 $\mu$M Spd (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_lc3ii}: \textbf{A}). With regards to rilmenidine treatment, no significant differences in the LC3-II turnover were observed in all groups [control (0.45 $\pm$ 0.49), 0.1 $\mu$M Ril (0.30 $\pm$ 0.29), 1 $\mu$M Ril (0.27 $\pm$ 0.32) and 10 $\mu$M Ril (0.15 $\pm$ 0.36)], however, there is a progressive trend in decline with an increase in Ril concentration (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_lc3ii}: \textbf{B}).

\section{Effect of low and high concentration spermidine and rilmenidine on autophagy pathway intermediates and autophagosome flux using quantitative FM}
In order to assess the effect of spermidine and rilmenidine on the autophagy pathway intermediates i.e. autophagosomes, autolysosomes as well as autophagosome flux, GT 1-7 cells were transfected with a mRFP-GFP-LC3 plasmid \citep{yoshii2017} and imaged using a fluorescence microscopy. The mRFP-GFP-LC3 plasmid allows to detect pH dependent changes as it fluoresces red and green in the autophagosomes resulting in a yellow signal, while only fluorescing red in the autolysosome due to the quenching of GFP signal as a result of the auto-lysosomal acidity \citep{yoshii2017}. Transfected cells were treated with a low (1 $\mu$M) and a high (10 $\mu$M) concentration of spermidine and rilmenidine for 8 h. Subsequently, cells were exposed to BafA1 (400 nM) for further 4 h to completely block the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes \citep{DuToit2018b} and imaged with fluorescence microscopy using z-stack acquisition. The number of autophagosome puncta (nA, yellow puncta) and autolysomes (nAL, red puncta) before and after autophagy induction with spermidine and rilmenidine as well as before and after complete inhibition of autophagosome fusion with lysosomes was assessed. In addition, autophagic flux (J), which is the initial rate of increase in nA and nAL per cell after treatment with Baf A1 and transition time required for a cell to clean its pool were also measured \citep{DuToit2018a,DuToit2018b,loos2014}.

\subsection{Assessment of autophagosome pool size}
The number of autophagosome significantly increased in the BafA1 treated group (11.93  $\pm$ 1.69), 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 (14.48 $\pm$ 2.69, \textit{p} < 0.05) and 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 (17.33 $\pm$ 2.82, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control (3.90 $\pm$ 0.75) (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_poolsize1}: \textbf{A}). A significant increase was revealed in the 10 $\mu$M Spd + Baf compared to the BafA1 group. Moreover, a significant increase autophagosome number was observed in 1 $\mu$M Spd + Baf versus 1 $\mu$M Spd (2.00 $\pm$ 0.62) and in 10 $\mu$M Spd + Baf versus 10 $\mu$M Spd (4.03 $\pm$ 0.82) (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_poolsize1}: \textbf{A}).

Rilmenidine treatment resulted in a significant increase in the number of autophagosomes in the BafA1 treated group (11.93 $\pm$ 1.69, \textit{p} < 0.05), and a significant decrease in the 1 $\mu$M Ril (0.03 $\pm$ 0.03, \textit{p} < 0.05) and 10 $\mu$M Ril (0.03 $\pm$ 0.03, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control group (3.90 $\pm$ 0.75) (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_poolsize1}: \textbf{B}). A significant decrease was revealed in the 1 $\mu$M Ril, 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (2.45 $\pm$ 0.60, \textit{p} < 0.05), 10 $\mu$M Ril and 10$\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (3.00 $\pm$ 0.72, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the BafA1 treated group. Furthermore, a significant increase autophagosome number was observed in 1 $\mu$M Ril + Baf versus 1 $\mu$M Ril and in 10 $\mu$M Ril + Baf versus 10$\mu$M Ril.

  \label{fig:30_spd_ril_poolsize1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Assessment of autolysosome pool size}
Next, the total number of autolysosomes was quantitatively assessed.  Autolysosomes number (AL) significantly increased in 1 $\mu$M Spd (36.79 $\pm$ 4.31, \textit{p} < 0.05) and 10 $\mu$M Spd (36.63 $\pm$ 2.04, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control groups (24.60 $\pm$ 3.04) (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_poolsize2}: \textbf{A}). No significant differences were observed in the BafA1 treated group compared to all other groups.

With regards to the rilmenidine treatment, a robust and significant increase in the number of autolysosomes was observed in 1 $\mu$M Ril (138.90 $\pm$ 6.61), 1 $mu$M Ril + BafA1 (107.60 $\pm$ 7.45), 10 $\mu$M Ril (104.70 $\pm$ 5.75) and 10 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (102.00 $\pm$ 7.13) compared to the control (24.60 $\pm$ 3.04) and BafA1 treated group (28.13 $\pm$ 3.0), with no significant differences observed between control and BafA1 group (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_poolsize2}: \textbf{B}). In addition, a significant decrease in the number of AL was observed in 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 compared to 1 $\mu$M Ril and in 10 $\mu$M Ril compared 1 $\mu$M Ril (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_poolsize2}: \textbf{B}).

  \label{fig:30_spd_ril_poolsize2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Assessment of autophagosomes flux and transition time}
Next, autophagy flux i.e. the rate of protein degradation through autophagy \citep{klionsky2016,loos2014} and the transition time ($\tau$) i.e. the time required for a cell to clear its autophagosome pool size \citep{DuToit2018b,loos2014} were assessed. A concentration dependent increase in rate of autophagosome number accumulation following complete inhibition with BafA1 was observed following 8 h treatment with spermidine at 1 $\mu$M (3.12 nA/h/cell) and 10 $\mu$M Spd (3.32 nA/h/cell) compared to the basal flux in control cells (2.01 nA/h/cell) (\Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_flux}: Left). In contrast, treatment with rilmenidine resulted in a decrease in autophagosome flux at 1 $\mu$M (0.60 nA/h/cell) and 10 $\mu$M (0.74 nA/h/cell) compared to the basal flux in control cells (2.01 nA/h) as shown in \Cref{fig:30_spd_ril_flux} (Right). Of note, a major increase in the autolysosomes pool size was observed upon rilmenidine treatment. Further analysis of the transition time showed that 1 $\mu$M Spd required 0.64 h to turn over the autophagosome pool, while 10 $\mu$M Spd required 1.21 h compared to 2 h needed by the control cells to turn over its pool. On the other hand, rilmenidine required 0.05 h and 0.040 h with a low and high dose respectively to clear its entire pool compared to the control (2 h) (\Cref{tab:30_flux}).

\section{Effect of low and high concentration of spermidine and rilmenidine on p62 puncta using FM}
\subsection{Assessment of p62 puncta}

In order to assess the effect of spermidine and rilmenidine on autophagy substrate p62, GT 1-7 cells were treated as required and immuno-stained for p62. Cells were imaged using fluorescence microscopy and the total number of p62 puncta was counted using image J. 

A significant increase in the number of p62 puncta was observed following treatment with Baf (105.10 $\pm$ 16.56, \textit{p} < 0.05), 1 $\mu$M Spd + Baf (130.40 $\pm$ 22.67, \textit{p} < 0.05) and 10 $\mu$M Spd + Baf (134.50 $\pm$ 35.71, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control (37.13 $\pm$ 8.02) (\Cref{fig:30_fluorescent_graph}: \textbf{A} and \Cref{fig:30_fluorescent}: Left). Similarly, a significant increase in p62 puncta was observed in 1 $\mu$M Spd + Baf versus 1 $\mu$M Spd and in 10 $\mu$M Spd + Baf versus 10 $\mu$M Spd, suggesting that the accumulation of p62 cargo takes place at basal and autophagy induced conditions. 

Similarly, upon rilmenidine treatment, a significant increase in the number of p62 puncta was observed in the Baf treated group (197.60 $\pm$ 18.87, \textit{p} < 0.05), 1 $\mu$M Ril + Baf (164.40 $\pm$ 28.48, \textit{p} < 0.05) and 10 $\mu$M Ril + Baf (146.80 $\pm$ 16.34, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control (92.39 $\pm$ 8.71) (\Cref{fig:30_fluorescent_graph}: \textbf{B} and \Cref{fig:30_fluorescent}: Right). In addition, a significant increase was observed in 1 $\mu$M Ril + Baf versus 1 $\mu$M Ril and in 10 $\mu$M Ril + Baf versus 10 $\mu$M Ril.

\section{Effect of low and high concentration spermidine and rilmenidine on autophagic vacuoles using TEM}
\subsection{Assessment of AVs}

TEM remains one of the critical tools to assess the autophagic pathway \citep{klionsky2016}, particularly, the abundance and size of the AVs.  In order to assess the effect of spermidine and rilmenidine on AVs, GT 1-7 cells were treated as required and prepared for TEM analysis. After imaging acquisition, the surface area and the number of AVs were analysed using image J. The results indicate a significant increase in the surface area of AVs in the BafA1 group (14.55 $\pm$ 0.33, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control cells (12.54 $\pm$ 0.61), while a significant decrease was observed with 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 (9.65 $\pm$ 0.24, \textit{p} < 0.05) (Fig. 3.8 A \& B.i). A significant reduction in size of AVs was observed in 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 and 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to the BafA1 treated group. In addition, the surface area of AVs was significantly increased in 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1, while it was significantly decreased in 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to 1 $\mu$M Spd and in 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to10 $\mu$M Spd (Fig. 3.8 A \& B.i).

In terms of autophagic vacuole abundance, a significant increase in the number of AVs per cell was observed in the BafA1 treated group (18.58 $\pm$ 2.27, \textit{p} < 0.05), in 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 (16.56 $\pm$ 2.64, \textit{p} < 0.05) and in 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 (17.42 $\pm$ 1.87, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control (5.05 $\pm$ 0.72) (Fig. 3.8 A \& B.ii). 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 and 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 resulted in a significant increase in the number of AVs when compared to 1 $\mu$M Spd versus 10 $\mu$M Spd, respectively (Fig. 3.8 A \& B.ii).

%cross reference fig (Fig. 3.8 A \& B.ii).(Fig. 3.8 A \& B.ii) and add fig3.8

Rilmenidine treatment (Fig. 3.9 A \& B.i) resulted in a significant increase in the surface area of AVs following treatment with 1 $\mu$M Ril (37.59 $\pm$ 1.04, p \textit{p} < 0.05), 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (46.06 $\pm$ 1.25, \textit{p} < 0.05), 10 $\mu$M Ril (49.71 $\pm$ 2.02), and 10 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (36.55 $\pm$ 0.89, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control (25.39 $\pm$ 1.91) and BafA1 group (25.64 $\pm$ 0.94), with, however, no significant differences between the control and BafA1 group. In addition, a significant increase in the surface area of the AVs was detected in 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 versus 1 $\mu$M Ril, and in 10 $\mu$M Ril treatment versus 1 $\mu$M Ril, while a significant decrease was observed in 10 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 versus 10 $\mu$M Ril  treated cells (Fig. 3.9 A \& B.i).

A significant increase in the number of AVs was observed in the BafA1 treated group (18.65 $\pm$ 1.91, \textit{p} < 0.05), 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (21.67 $\pm$ 2.74, \textit{p} < 0.05), and 10$\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (24.35 $\pm$ 2.23, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control (5.75 $\pm$ 0.71) (Fig. 3.9 A \& B.ii). In addition, a significant increase was observed in 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 versus 1 $\mu$M Ril and in 10 $\mu$M Ril + Baf versus 10 $\mu$M Ril, with no significant differences observed the between low and high concentration of rilmenidine (1 $\mu$M versus 10 $\mu$M).

\section{Discussion: Autophagic flux assessment}

Although autophagy modulation using pharmacological agents has received considerable attention over the past years and although many autophagy modulating drugs are now known, it remains unclear to what extent different concentrations would change autophagic activity or autophagic flux, especially given the dynamic and cell specific nature of protein degradation and proteolysis. One of the challenges in this context is to accurately assess and dissect the pathway intermediates i.e. autophagosomal and autolysosomal pool sizes and their turnover in a highly sensitive manner, in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms that govern a particular autophagic activity. Although rilmenidine and spermidine are known to induce autophagy, the extent to which different concentrations of rilmenidine and spermidine  change  autophagic flux, is unclear. To this end, the autophagic flux profile of spermidine and rilmenidine was assessed by blocking autophagosome/lysosome fusion while monitoring the accumulation of pathway intermediates ( i.e. autophagosomes, autolysosomes, p62 protein levels and AVs), quantifying autophagic flux and transition time by using a combination of western blotting, z-stack based fluorescence imaging and TEM. Here we report that autophagy flux through standard analysis using either western blotting, TEM or FM analysis could result in the misinterpretation of data because not all methods are equally sensitive. We show that, in order to measure and discern autophagic flux accurately, one requires western blotting to assess the changes in LC3 II and p62 protein expression, TEM, to assess AVs and FM to assess p62 puncta, LC3 turnover and most importantly, to distinguish between autophagosome and autolysosome pool sizes. Secondly, we report that the size in vacuolar structures in response to the treatment assessment plays a major role in autophagic flux and deserves further investigation.

\subsection{The effect of spermidine and rilmenidine on cell viability}

Although various concentrations of rilmenidine and spermidine have been used to modulate autophagic flux in different cell types \citep{Perera2018,Wang2018}, a suitable, yet non-toxic concentration of rilmenidine and spermidine that induces autophagic flux in GT 1-7 cells had to be established. Therefore, a concentration dependent response study of rilmenidine and spermidine modulation on cellular viability was performed using WST-1. The results showed no decrease in viability (Fig.3.1), suggesting that both drugs exerted no toxicity at the concentrations tested. In agreement with our results assessing rilmenidine,  a recent \textit{in vitro} study by \citet{Perera2018} demonstrated that rilmenidine  at the  0.1, 1, \& 10 $\mu$M does not impair cell viability in mouse neuroblastoma x spinal cord (NSC-34) cells after 24 h treatment intervention. To our surprise, we found a small improvement in cellular viability (increase in reductive capacity) which reached significance with 1 and 10 $\mu$M Spd and 10 $\mu$M Ril compared to the control group (Fig.3.1). In addition, 10 $\mu$M Spd and 10 $\mu$M Ril resulted in the highest reductive capacity compared to 0.1 and 1 $\mu$M Spd and with 0.1 and 1 $\mu$M Ril, respectively, suggesting a potential mitochondrial or metabolic response. Although previous studies have assessed cellular viability in the context of rilmenidine and spermidine, none have reported an enhancement, suggesting a potential metabolic effect. In fact, previous studies  have reported cytotoxic effects of spermidine in different cells lines \citep{He1993,Poulin1995,Poulin1993}, supporting our findings of 100 $\mu$M Spd resulting in a significant reduction in cell viability, as shown in the supplementary material (S1). A recent study reported a dose-dependent cytotoxicity effect after 48 h treatment with spermidine and spermine (0, 5,10, 20, 40, 60 , 80 and 100 $\mu$M) in drug-resistant cell lines, but not in their wild type cell lines \citep{Wang2018}. It has been suggested that the cytotoxic effects observed with spermidine or spermine might not be caused by these drugs directly but may be related to the metabolites of polyamines, since other polyamine such as putrescine and triethylenetetramine (TETA) did not show any significant cytotoxicity effect on all the tested cell lines tested \citep{Wang2018}. Taken together, our results allowed us to choose a low and high concentration of spermidine and rilmenidine for subsequent experiments.

\subsection{ The effect of spermidine and rilmenidine on autophagic flux using WB}

To further identify a concentration that would have maximal autophagy inducing effects, western blot analysis was performed, to assess the abundance and turnover of LC3-II and p62 protein. Results show the highest abundance of LC3 II only with 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to the control group and 0.1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 (Fig.3.2.A i \& iii). However, trends towards an increase in the accumulation of LC3 II were observed when degradation was inhibited with BafA1 in all treatment groups compared to the respective BafA1 untreated groups, with an enhanced accumulation indicated at the highest concentration of spermidine. These results suggest the presence of a basal as well as increased autophagic activity. In addition, these results suggest a concentration depended effect. Basal autophagy flux is better revealed in the p62 western blot data, where the highest abundance of p62 was indicated in the BafA1 treated group compared to control group (Fig.3.2.A ii \& iii). Moreover, significant abundance of p62 was indicated in 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to the control group, although trends were indicated in the presence of BafA1 in all treatment groups compared to the respective BafA1 untreated groups (Fig.3.2.A ii \& iii). These results suggest the presence of autophagic flux and show that indeed both LC3 II and p62 protein levels need to be assessed in order to monitor changes in autophagic flux in a sensitive manner. Notably, only the high spermidine concentration induced heavily autophagic flux which can be clearly seen in the turnover of LC3 II (Fig 3.3.A). In line with our findings, 10 $\mu$M Spd was found to increase LC3 lipidation and GPF-LC3 puncta above  basal levels yet not significantly in Human colorectal carcinoma (HCT) 116 cells when treated for 2 h \citep{Morselli2011}. Although no significance was observed, treatment with spermidine in this particular study induced autophagic flux 2 times above basal levels \citep{Morselli2011}. The none significant increase observed in this study might be due to the short duration of incubation with spermidine in these cells. In support of this, a recent study by \citet{Yue2017} reported a concentration dependent increase in LC3-II after 4 h of incubation with spermidine at  0, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 $\mu$M in MEF and Hela cells.  In another study, 20 nM of Spd which is 5 times lower than the lowest concentration used in our study (0.1 $\mu$M), was found to increase LC3 II and p62 levels above control levels in MEF cells after exposure of 8 h \citep{DuToit2018a}. Others reported a basal as well as induced autophagic flux with 100 $\mu$M Spd incubated for 4 h in U2OS cells  \citep{Pietrocola2015}, in Hela and MEF \citep{Yue2017} and in HCT cells citep{Morselli2011}. We found that 100 $\mu$M Spd reduces cell viability in GT 17, hence we did not use this concentration. All together these results suggest that the autophagy induction by spermidine is dependent in a concentration, time of incubation and cell type used.
%cross reference figs

Treatment with rilmenidine had no effect on the abundance of LC3 II (Fig.3.2.B i \& iii) and in LC3 II turnover (Fig.3.3.B), however, good trends were observed in in the presence of BafA1 in all treatment groups compared to the respective BafA1 untreated groups treatment (Fig.3.2.B i \& iii), suggesting the presence of basal flux.  In contrast to our findings, various studies reported a significant increase in LC3 II following treatment with various concentrations of rilmenidine. \citet{Williams2008} reported a concentration dependent increase in LC3 II with 0.3, 1 and 3 $\mu$M Ril incubated for 24 h in SK-N-SH cells. \citet{Rose2010} reported a significant increase in LC3 II with 1 $\mu$M Ril in PC12 cells after 8 h of incubation in the presence and absence of BafA1, while \citet{Perera2018}  reported the same effect with 10 $\mu$M Ril for 24 h  in the absence of BafA1 in two different cells types, NSC-34 and H9 human embryonic stem cell-derived spinal motor neurons expressing human wide type (WT) SOD1. A response with rilmenidine is better revealed in p62 blots where a significant accumulation of p62 was seen in 1 $\mu$M Ril, 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1, and 10 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 compared to the control, and  in 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 versus BafA1 and 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 versus 0.1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 (Fig.3.2.B ii \& iii). This data suggests an autophagy enhancing effect, which is best revealed through the impacted p62 clearance. In support of our findings, rilmenidine at 10 $\mu$M Ril for 24 h was found to significantly increase p62 accumulation in NSC-34 expressing WT SOD1 \citep{Perera2018}. In the same study, rilmenidine at the same concentration and incubation period was found to significantly decrease p62 accumulation in H9 human embryonic stem cell-derived spinal motor neurons expressing WT SOD1  \citep{Perera2018}, suggesting an autophagy dependent cell type mechanism. Since p62 and LC3 II can sometimes result in distinct response, their expression needs to be assessed together.

\subsection{Assessment of autophagosome, autolysosome pool size, autophagosome flux and transition time}

Next, in order to assess the effect of low and high doses of spermidine and rilmenidine on autophagic flux, the total number of autophagosomes and autolysosome, autophagosome flux and transition time were assessed using a single cell analysis-based fluorescence microscopy in GT 17 cells. Our results with spermidine revealed a significant accumulation of autophagosome following treatment with BafA1, 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 and 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to the control (Fig. 3.4.A). Secondly, our results show a significant accumulation of autophagosomes with 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to the BafA1 group, suggesting a concentration depended induced autophagic flux, in agreement with our western blotting data.  Thirdly, we reveal a significant accumulation of autophagosome following treatment with BafA1, 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 and 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to control, 1 $\mu$M Spd and in 10 $\mu$M Spd respectively, suggesting a presence of basal autophagic flux in all 3 groups. These results are in contrast with the data obtained with western blot where a significant change in autophagic flux was achieved only with the highest concentration of spermidine, suggesting that autophagosome assessment with FM is more sensitive. Similarly, treatment with rilmenidine revealed a significant accumulation of autophagosome following treatment with BafA1, 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 and 10 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 compared to control, 1 $\mu$M Ril and in 10 $\mu$M Ril respectively (Fig. 3.4.B), again suggesting the presence of basal autophagic flux in 3 groups. These results are in contrast with the data obtained with western blot where we could only observe trends but did not achieve significance, again suggesting that autophagosome assessment with FM is more sensitive. In line with our findings, other studies have shown an increase in autophagosome accumulation following treatment with 100 $\mu$M spermidine for 4 h in the presence and absence of BafA1 in U2OS cells expressing GFP-LC3  \citep{Pietrocola2015} and MEF cells expressing RFP-LC3 \citep{Yue2017}.  Importantly, we also observed a significant decline to in autophagosome pool size with the lowest and high concentration of rilmenidine in the presence and absence of BafA1 compared to cells treated with BafA1, suggesting that rilmenidine stimulates autophagy resulting in all autophagosomes being shunted towards autolysosomes. 

%cross ref fig

Indeed, we observed a robust and significant accumulation in the number of autolysosomes in low and high rilmenidine in the absence and presence of BafA1 compared to the control and BafA1 treated group (Fig. 3.5.B), suggesting that autophagosomes were shunted towards autolysosomes. In support of these findings,  rilmenidine (10 $\mu$M Ril) was shown to significantly increase the accumulation of mature autolysosomes compared to untreated cells \citep{Perera2018}. It is reasonable to propose that the enhanced autophagic flux with rilmenidine converts autophagosomes to autolysosomes. Autolysosome accumulated more in the lower concentration of rilmenidine compared with lower concentration of rilmenidine plus BafA1, indicating a recycling of autolysosomes back to lysosomes. To our surprise, the lower concentration of rilmenidine induced the accumulation of autolysomes compared with the higher concentration, suggesting that rilmendine low might enhance autophagy better than the higher concentration, leading to the rapid conversion of autophagosomes to autolysosomes. Following spermidine treatment, autolysosomes significantly accumulated with low and high doses of spermidine compared to the control group (Fig.3.5. A), with no significant differences observed in the BafA1 treated group compared to all other groups. Other studies have found an increase in autolysosomal pool following autophagy induction with pharmacological agents including spermidine \citep{DuToit2018a}. Altogether, these results suggest that both autophagosomes and autolysosomes must be assessed to reveal the true autophagic flux, otherwise it would have been missed that both low and high rilmenidine induces basal and induced flux by assessing autolysosomes, as this was not revealed with assessment of autophagosomes. 
%cross ref fig

Lastly, our results indicate a concentration dependent enhanced autophagosome flux following spermidine treatment compared to basal flux in control cells (Fig. 3.6. left). Treatment with rilmenidine resulted in a decline in autophagosome flux below basal flux which remained decreased but at the same time there was a major shunting of the autophagosomes to autolysosomes (Fig. 3.6. right). Further analysis revealed that spermidine low required 0.64 h, while spermidine high required 1.21 h to clear all its autophagosome pool compared to 2 h needed by the control cells to turn over its pool. On the other end, rilmenidine required 0.05 h and 0.040 h with a low and high dose respectively to clear its entire pool compared to the control (2 h) (Table 3.1). 
%cross ref fig and table 3.1

Overall, our data reveal novel and critical insights into the autophagic flux profile of spermidine and rilmenidine under physiological conditions. Here, we were able to define the basal flux for the GT 17 cells as 2 autophagosomes per hour per cell. Secondly, we are able to define the transition time to turn over the basal pool as 2 h. Thirdly, we could pick up the differences in spermidine doses as they increased flux in a manner dependent on concentration, but not in rilmenidine, as they both reduced flux.

\subsection{Effect of low and high concentration spermidine and rilmenidine on p62 puncta using FM}

Next, to assess whether a low and high dose of spermidine and rilmenidine has effect on autophagy substrate p62, a single cell analysis-based fluorescence microscopy was performed in GT 1-7 immuno-stained for p62 in the absence and presence of saturating concentration of BafA1. The results reveal a significant accumulation of p62 puncta following treatment with BafA1, 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 and 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to the control (Fig.3.7.A \& B) and following treatment  with BafA1, 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1  and 10 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 compared to the control (Fig.3.7.C \& D). Moreover, a significant accumulation of p62 puncta was revealed in 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 versus 1 $\mu$M Spd, 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 versus 10 $\mu$M Spd, 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 versus 1 $\mu$M Ril and in 10 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 versus 10 $\mu$M Ril. These results suggest that the accumulation of p62 cargo takes place at basal and autophagy induced conditions. Overall, these results imply that p62 counts are more sensitive compared to the p62 protein expression measured with western blotting as we can reveal that there is always flux in each group, with and without BafA1, always significantly different in the presence of BafA1. Interestingly, we observe a cargo increase with p62 in the rilmenidine treatment but not with LC3 response (i.e. autophagome pool). These results suggest that the p62 we are observing is cargo that is accumulating outside of the LC3, meaning it is not already associated with LC3 positive structures and thus cannot be degraded. This might also be explained by the trends that we observed with LC3 blots that did not reach significance and the major changes observed with autolysosomes, somehow this must be responsible for this particular phenotype.

\subsection{Effect of low and high concentration spermidine and rilmenidine on autophagic vacuoles using TEM}

TEM was the first technique used to describe and detect autophagy in the 1950s \citep{Deter1967}. It remains the most powerful technique for assessing the autophagic pathway due to its ability to reveal the ultrastructural information of autophagosomes, lysosomes and autolysosomes at the highest resolution (0.1 - 10 nm range), allowing for quantitative analysis of these structures to be performed \citep{klionsky2016}. Despite the high resolution of TEM, it is sometimes difficult to discern between autophagosomes and autolysosomes based on morphology only thus these structures are collectively termed AVs \citep{Eskelinen2008,klionsky2016} and are usually assessed in the presence or absence of lysosomal inhibitors such as BafA1 in order to distinguish the changes in autophagic flux in response to treatment \citep{Eskelinen2011,klionsky2016}.

After imaging acquisition, the surface area and the number of AVs were analysed.  The results indicate a decrease in size of AVs after autophagy induction with low and high dose of spermidine in the presence of BafA1 and with spermidine high compared to BafA1 (Fig. 3.8 A \& B.i). To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a decrease in size upon spermidine treatment in the presence of BafA1. Secondly, our results reveal a rapid accumulation of AVs following inhibition of degradation in BafA1 group, 1 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 and 10 $\mu$M Spd + BafA1 compared to the control, 1 $\mu$M Spd and 10 $\mu$M Spd, respectively (Fig. 3.8 A \& B.ii), suggesting the presence of basal flux.  Treatment with rilmenidine revealed to our surprise, a concentration dependent increase in the size of AVs following autophagy induction (Fig. 3.9 A \& B.i). Secondly, we further detect an increase in the size of AVs above basal after autophagy induction with rilmenidine in the presence of BafA1. These results suggest that the cargo degradation is likely impacted and deserves further investigation. Thirdly, our results reveal a rapid accumulation of AVs following inhibition of degradation in BafA1 group, 1 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 and 10 $\mu$M Ril + BafA1 compared to the control, 1 $\mu$M Ril and 10 $\mu$M Ril, respectively (Fig. 3.9 A \& B.ii), suggesting again the presence of basal flux. Lastly, a significant accumulation of AVs was detected with rilmenidine high in the presence of BafA1 compared to BafA1 alone, suggesting again a concentration dependent effect.  To our knowledge, our results provide for the first time a concentration depended effect in the size and number of AVs following autophagy induction.  In line with our findings, others have reported an increase in the size and number of AVs following autophagy induction using EM. \citet{Mizushima2004a} reported an increase in the number and size of AVs following autophagy induction in cells and in mice tissues. In another study \textit{in vitro}, an increase in the number of AVs was reported  following autophagy induction \citep{Lum2005}. Similar findings have been reported by others in vivo \citep{Alirezaei2010,Ericsson1969,Mizushima2004a}. Since we observed no changes with BafA1 in terms of size but a major increase in AVs accumulation which remained increased upon BafA1 treatment, above basal control levels, these results suggest that the accumulated AVs might be all autolysosomes, as we observed massive accumulations of autolysosomes and not autophagosomes with rilmenidine (Fig.3.4B \& 3.5.B). This requires further investigation as we could not discern between autophagosomes and autolysosomes with just TEM. One way to do this is through CLEM and will be discussed in chapter 6.
%crossref fig
In summary, our results revealed a concentration depended effect with spermidine and to a certain extent with rilmenidine on autophagic flux under normal physiological conditions. Spermidine is a suitable autophagy inducer in GT 1-7. It is impossible to say that rilmenidine is not a suitable autophagy inducer in GT 1-7 as we do not observe significant changes, because maybe the effect of rilmenidine observed by others are due to the moving cargo to autolysosomes but the cargo is not being degraded. We showed that each method revealed something different and has its own sensitivity and that autophagy flux through standard analysis using either of these techniques alone could result in the misinterpretation of data. We show that in order to measure autophagic flux accurately, one requires to use the combination of western blot, TEM, FM and most importantly to distinguish between the autophagosomes and autolysosomes using FM or better yet CLEM. We report that the size in vacuolar structures play a major role and deserved further investigation. In conclusion, western blotting is very crude and gives rough indication while vesicle analysis allows us to describe finer. The turnover (net flux) analysis allows to pick up differences better. AVs on the EM allows to see different sizes in the structures and autolysosomes show that the pool size is changing in the sense of clearance, turning autophagosomes over to autolysosomes and that the pool increases but not cleared fast. Therefore, different methods have different sensitivity and is advisable to choose a number of techniques if one wants to fully understand effect on autophagy modulators under normal and disease conditions
