  	\caption[]{\textbf{The effect of spermidine concentrations on cell viability.} GT1-7 cells were treated with 0.1, 1, 10 \& 100 $\mu$M of Spd for 8 h. Subsequently, reductive capacity as a measure of cell viability was assessed using WST-1 assay. All results are presented as a percentage of the control (mean $\pm$ SEM), \textit{n} = 3 with 6 replicates per group. * = \textit{p} < 0.05 vs control, \# = \textit{p} < 0.05 vs 0.1 $\mu$M Spd, \$ = \textit{p} < 0.05 vs 1 $\mu$M Spd and \& = \textit{p} < 0.05 vs 10 $\mu$M Spd.}
