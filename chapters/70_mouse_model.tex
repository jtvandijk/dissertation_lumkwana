\chapter{The ffect of spermidine on PQ induced brain injury model of Alzheimerâ€™s disease}
\section{Introduction}
In order to assess the role of autophagy enhancement in an \textit{in vivo} scenario, a PQ induced neuronal injury model was employed \citep{Chen2012}, using a GFP-LC3 transgenic mice \citep{Mizushima2004a}. Specifically, since the concentration dependent effect of autophagy induction was of major interest, this part of the work was focussing on spermidine at two distinct concentrations. In this context, we focused primarily on the brain regions that are highly susceptibility to neuronal injury as we previously reviewed in detail \citep{lumkwana2017}. These regions include the hippocampus and the cortex which are impacted in early and late stages of AD respectively and have been shown to have manifest with major pathological changes, including cell loss. So far, the role of spermidine in a mouse model of PQ-induced injury has not been assessed. Therefore, the aims of this chapter were to assess the extent of PQ induced toxicity in terms lipid peroxidation and to assess the role of spermidine in protein clearance, tubulin acetylation and subsequent potential protection. A total of 72 mice expressing GFP-LC3 were randomly selected into 6 groups of 12 consisting of (1) control (saline solution), (2) PQ, (3) 0.3 mM Spd, (4) 0.3 mM Spd + PQ, (5) 3 mM Spd and (6) 3 mM Spd + PQ. The study was conducted for 21 days in which saline and PQ was administered every 3 days for 21 days \citep{Chen2012}, with a total of 6 injections, while other animals had ad libitum access to spermidine in the drinking water for the duration of the treatment. After 21 days, animals were sacrificed and brain was extracted, weighted and dissected into different regions, namely hippocampus and cortex and prepared accordingly for H\&E, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Markers of oxidative stress (4HNE), autophagy (LC3 II, p62, LAMP2a), brain injury [glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and amyloid precursor protein (APP)] and microtubule stability (acetylated $\alpha$-tubulin) were assessed. 

\section{Effect of treatment intervention on brain weight}
In order to assess the effect of the treatment intervention on brain weight, cerebral tissue was weighed immediately after animal sacrifice and brain extraction. Results show a significant increase in the brain weight in the PQ treated group (1.08 $\pm$ 0.02, \textit{p} < 0.05), 0.3 mM Spd (1.21 $\pm$ 0.04, \textit{p} < 0.05), 0.3 mM Spd + PQ (1.20 $\pm$ 0.01, p < 0.05), 3 mM Spd (1.16 $\pm$ 0.01, \textit{p} < 0.05) and 3 mM Spd + PQ (1.19 $\pm$ 0.04, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control group (1.00 $\pm$ 0.01) (Fig.7.1). In addition, a significant increase in brain weight was also observed in the 0.3mM Spd, 0.3mM Spd + PQ, 3mM Spd and 3mM Spd + PQ compared to the PQ treated group.

\section{Effect of treatment intervention on hippocampus and cortex}
The hippocampus and cortex are regions susceptible to pathological changes particularly in PD (Braak et al., 2004, 2003, 1998), but also in AD (Braak et al., 2000, 1998; Braak and Braak, 1991; Braak and Del Tredici, 2012). Therefore, the effect of the treatment intervention in a PQ-induced brain injury model was assessed using Heamatoxylin and Eosin (H\&E), western blotting and immunofluorescence. Protein expression levels indicative of oxidative stress (4HNE), brain injury (GFAP and APP), autophagy activity (LC3 II, p62, and LAMP2A), and microtubule stability (acetylated $\alpha$-tubulin) were assessed in both brain regions and complemented with immunofluorescence.

\subsection{Lipid peroxidation (4HNE) assessment using western blotting}
The lipid peroxidation end product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE), a marker for oxidative stress was assessed in response to treatment intervention. Three distinct 4HNE protein adducts bands (35, 45, 52 kDa) were identified. At 35 kDa, 4HNE signal was significantly increased in the PQ treated group (1.84 $\pm$ 0.18, \textit{p} < 0.05), while significantly decreased in the 0.3 mM Spd (0.29 $\pm$ 0.04, \textit{p} < 0.05), 0.3 mM Spd + PQ (0.39 $\pm$ 0.08, \textit{p} < 0.05), 3 mM Spd (0.36 $\pm$ 0.09, \textit{p} < 0.05) and 3 mM Spd + PQ (0.57 $\pm$ 0.09, \textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the control group (0.88 $\pm$ 0.10) (Fig.7.3.A.i). Moreover, a significant decrease in 4HNE signal was also observed with 0.3 mM Spd, 0.3 mM Spd + PQ, 3 mM Spd and 3mM Spd + PQ (\textit{p} < 0.05) compared to the PQ treated group. 

Similarly at 45 kDa, 4HNE signal was significantly increased in the PQ treated group (1.41 $\pm$ 0.22, \textit{p} < 0.05), while significantly decreased in the 0.3 mM Spd + PQ (0.13 $\pm$ 0.03, \textit{p} < 0.05), 3 mM Spd (0.32 $\pm$ 0.05) and 3 mM Spd + PQ (0.23 $\pm$ 0.05) compared to the control (0.95 $\pm$ 0.13) (Fig.7.3.A.ii). Additionally, in comparison to the PQ treated group, a significant decrease in 4HNE expression was also observed in the 0.3 mM Spd, 0.3 mM Spd + PQ, 3 mM Spd and 3 mM Spd + PQ. Furthermore, a significant decrease was observed in the 0.3 mM Spd + PQ and 3 mM Spd (\textit{p} < 0.05) compared to 0.3 mM Spd.

Lastly at 53 kDa , no significant differences were observed in 4HNE signal in the PQ treated group (1.42 $\pm$ 0.34), 0.3 mM Spd (1.48 $\pm$ 0.22) and in 3 mM Spd (0.76 $\pm$ 0.22) compared to the control (1.00 $\pm$ 0.12), however, a significant decrease in 4HNE signal was detected in the 0.3 mM Spd + PQ (0.46 $\pm$ 0.15) and 3 mM Spd + PQ (0.45 $\pm$ 0.07) group (Fig.7.3.A.iii). In comparison to the PQ treated group, a significant decrease in 4HNE signal was revealed in the 0.3 mM Spd + PQ, 3 mM Spd and 3 mM Spd + PQ. Furthermore, a significant decrease was observed in the 0.3 mM Spd + PQ (\textit{p} < 0.05) compared to 0.3 mM Spd and in 3 mM Spd (\textit{p} < 0.05) compared to 0.3 mM Spd.
