\chapter{Abstract}

\textit{Introduction} - Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, particularly in the brain regions important for learning and memory. The neuropathology of AD is characterised by two molecular hallmarks apparent in the brain tissue; the intracellular protein aggregates known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of hyper-phosphorylated Tau and extracellular amyloid beta (A$\beta$) plaques, composed of A$\beta$ peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), both of which occur as a result of an imbalance in proteostasis. Although, we have advanced our understanding of the molecular machinery that regulates the rate of protein degradation through autophagy at basal levels and the many aspects of its dysfunction in AD, the deviation of autophagic activity from basal levels and its change during disease pathogenesis in neuronal tissue remains largely unclear. Over the recent years, we have made substantial progress in modulating autophagy using pharmacological agents \textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo} and mounting evidence points towards autophagy modulation using pharmacological agents as one of the major therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. Although, spermidine and rilmenidine both enhance autophagy, the exact relationship between autophagy activity, the extent of protein clearance and death onset remains unclear. Moreover, the impact of concentration differences on autophagic flux and on subsequent protein clearance and neuronal toxicity is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to unravel the role of autophagy modulation, using a high and a low concentration of spermidine and rilmenidine, on autophagic flux, neuronal toxicity and protein clearance using distinct model systems. 

\textit{Methods} - For the \textit{in vitro} model, murine hypothalamus-derived GT1-7 neuronal cell and the mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cell line stably expressing Swedish  double mutation APP695 (Swe) associated with AD pathology were used. GT 1-7 cells and GT 1-7 transfected with mRFP-GFP-LC3 and GFP-LC3-RFP-LC3$\Delta$G were treated with a low and a high concentration of spermidine and rilmenidine in the presence of saturating concentrations of bafilomycin after which autophagic profile of these two drugs was characterized by assessing for cellular viability, autophagic flux, autophagosomes pool, autolysosome pool, autophagosome flux, transition time, p62 puncta and autophagic vacuoles using cellular viability assay, western blotting, fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy linked to quantitative morphometric analysis. In addition, potential protective effects of a low and a high concentration of  spermidine and rilmenidine were assessed in a PQ-induced neuronal toxicity model and in an APP over-expression model. Cellular viability assays, ROS damage, cell death onset and autophagic activity were performed in the PQ-induced toxicity model, while cellular viability assays, western blotting and protein clusters were assessed and quantified using single molecule imaging, i.e, d-STORM. Moreover, potential protective effects of spermidine at two distinct concentrations were assessed using transgenic mice expressing GFP-LC3 that were treated with PQ to induce neuronal toxicity associated with neurodegeneration. Lastly, a CLEM method was developed and used to assess the effects of low and high concentrations of spermidine on the localization of autophagosomes in 2 and 3 dimensions. 

\textit{Results} - Our results indicate a concentration-dependent effect of spermidine and rilmenidine on autophagic flux and that the detected change in the flux depends heavily on the specificity on the method used.  In addition, in an \textit{in vitro} model of PQ-induced toxicity, our results revealed that spermidine at a low concentration and not a high concentration protected against cell toxicity, ROS damage, cell death as well as microtubule destabilization in a manner that was dependent on autophagy. To our surprise, both concentrations of rilmenidine failed to protect against ROS damage and cell death and also failed to up-regulate autophagy in the same model.  Moreover, in an \textit{in vitro} model of neuronal toxicity induced by APP over-expression, our results showed that both concentrations of spermidine and rilmenidine protected against cytotoxicity. Spermidine at low concentration effectively cleared APP clusters and reduced their size, especially after 48 h of APP over-expression, while rilmenidine, reduced the number and size of APP clusters in a concentration-dependent manner at the same time point.  
Taken together, the \textit{in vitro} results reveal a concentration dependency effect, drug dependency effect, method specificity, a cell type specificity and injury specificity on autophagy and cell death control. \textit{In vivo}, our results revealed that PQ-induced toxicity impacts the brain regions differentially, with the hippocampus being highly susceptible to PQ injury followed by the cortex. Moreover, our results showed that both dosages of spermidine protected against oxidative stress, neuronal damage, microtubule destabilization, and upregulated autophagy, in the hippocampus and cortex. However, the lower dose of spermidine gave a stronger protection, although, autophagy was here upregulated in a manner dependent on the dose utilized, with the higher dose of spermidine increasing LC3-II in the hippocampus, while a lower dose increased LC3-II in the cortex. Lastly, we have successfully established a CLEM protocol and showed with this method that spermidine in combination with BafA1 decreases the volume while increasing the surface area of autophagosomes in a concentration-dependent manner. 

\textit{Conclusion} - Our results indicate the importance of using multiple tools to assess autophagy and show that a concentration-dependent effect on autophagic flux modulation exists. In addition, we also provided evidence of the distinct, context-dependent protective roles of spermidine and rilmenidine in an \textit{in vitro} model of APP over-expression as well as the protective roles of spermidine \textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo} models of PQ-induced neuronal toxicity. These results suggest that administration of spermidine may represent a favourable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. Further studies, using an \textit{in vivo} model over-expressing APP are warranted to further verify the protective effects of spermidine.
