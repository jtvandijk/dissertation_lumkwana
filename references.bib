	Abstract = {Studies of human genetics and pathophysiology have implicated the regulation of autophagy in inflammation, neurodegeneration, infection, and autoimmunity. These findings have motivated the use of small-molecule probes to study how modulation of autophagy affects disease-associated phenotypes. Here, we describe the discovery of the small-molecule probe BRD5631 that is derived from diversity-oriented synthesis and enhances autophagy through an mTOR-independent pathway. We demonstrate that BRD5631 affects several cellular disease phenotypes previously linked to autophagy, including protein aggregation, cell survival, bacterial replication, and inflammatory cytokine production. BRD5631 can serve as a valuable tool for studying the role of autophagy in the context of cellular homeostasis and disease.},

@article{Mitra2009,
	Abstract = {In a recent study, we investigated the relationship between inclusion body (IB) formation and the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in a primary neuron model of Huntington disease. We followed individual neurons over the course of days and monitored the level of mutant huntingtin (htt) (which causes Huntington disease), IB formation, UPS function, and neuronal toxicity. The accumulation of UPS substrates and neuronal toxicity increased with increasing levels of proteasome inhibition. The UPS was more impaired in neurons that subsequently formed IBs than in those that did not; however, after IBs formed, UPS function improved. These findings suggest that IB formation is a protective cellular response mediated in part by increased degradation of intracellular protein.},

	Abstract = {Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved cell survival process for degradation of long-lived proteins, damaged organelles and protein aggregates. The mammalian proteins p62 and NBR1 are selectively degraded by autophagy and can act as cargo receptors or adaptors for the autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated substrates. Despite differing in size and primary sequence, both proteins share a similar domain architecture containing an N-terminal PB1 domain, a LIR motif interacting with ATG8 family proteins, and a C-terminal UBA domain interacting with ubiquitin. The LIR motif is essential for their autophagic degradation, indicating that ATG8 family proteins are responsible for the docking of p62 and NBR1 to nucleating autophagosomes. p62 and NBR1 co-operate in the sequestration of misfolded and ubiquitinated proteins in p62 bodies and are both required for their degradation by autophagy. Here we discuss the role of p62 and NBR1 in degradation of ubiquitinated cargoes and the putative role of LIR as a general motif for docking of proteins to ATG8 family proteins. {\textcopyright}2009 Landes Bioscience.},

@article{Kumar2019,
	Abstract = {Syntaxin 17 (Stx17) has been implicated in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Here, we report that Stx17 functions in assembly of protein complexes during autophagy initiation. Stx17 is phosphorylated by TBK1 whereby phospho-Stx17 controls the formation of the ATG13 + FIP200 + mammalian pre-autophagosomal structure (mPAS) in response to induction of autophagy. TBK1 phosphorylates Stx17 at S202. During autophagy induction, Stx17 pS202 transfers from the Golgi, where its steady-state pools localize, to the ATG13 + FIP200 + mPAS. Stx17 pS202 was in complexes with ATG13 and FIP200, whereas its non-phosphorylatable mutant Stx17 S202A was not. Stx17 or TBK1 knockouts blocked ATG13 and FIP200 puncta formation. Stx17 or TBK1 knockouts reduced the formation of ATG13 protein complexes with FIP200 and ULK1. Endogenous Stx17 pS202 colocalized with LC3B following induction of autophagy. Stx17 knockout diminished LC3 response and reduced sequestration of the prototypical bulk autophagy cargo lactate dehydrogenase. We conclude that Stx17 is a TBK1 substrate and that together they orchestrate assembly of mPAS. Kumar et al. show that TBK1 phosphorylation of Stx17 is required for the formation of the mammalian pre-autophagosomal structure (mPAS). Phosphorylated Stx17 translocates from the Golgi to help assemble the cytoplasmic mPAS complex upon autophagy induction. Stx17 and TBK1 thus cooperate in autophagy initiation in addition to previously assigned functions.},

	Abstract = {Autophagy, a multistep lysosomal degradation pathway that supports nutrient recycling and metabolic adaptation, has been implicated as a process that regulates cancer. Although autophagy induction may limit the development of tumors, evidence in mouse models demonstrates that autophagy inhibition can limit the growth of established tumors and improve response to cancer therapeutics. Certain cancer genotypes may be especially prone to autophagy inhibition. Different strategies for autophagy modulation may be needed depending on the cancer context. Here, we review new advances in the molecular control of autophagy, the role of selective autophagy in cancer, and the role of autophagy within the tumor microenvironment and tumor immunity. We also highlight clinical efforts to repurpose lysosomal inhibitors, such as hydroxychloroquine, as anticancer agents that block autophagy, as well as the development of more potent and specific autophagy inhibitors for cancer treatment, and review future directions for autophagy research. Significance: Autophagy plays a complex role in cancer, but autophagy inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy in advanced cancer. A deeper understanding of autophagy within the tumor microenvironment has enabled the development of novel inhibitors and clinical trial strategies. Challenges and opportunities remain to identify patients most likely to benefit from this approach.},

The molecular machinery for selective autophagy must ensure efficient recognition and sequestration of the cargo within autophagosomes. Cargo specificity can be mediated by autophagic cargo receptors that specifically bind the cargo material and the autophagosomal membrane. Here we review the recent insights into the mechanisms that enable cargo receptors to confer selectivity and exclusivity to the autophagic process. We also discuss their different roles during starvation-induced and selective autophagy. We propose to classify autophagic events into cargo-independent and cargo-induced autophagosome formation events.},

@misc{Deng2017,
	Abstract = {Previously thought of as a nonselective digestion process, autophagy is now known to specifically degrade aggregated proteins and damaged cellular organelles through the action of autophagy receptors, which provides cellular quality control and maintains homeostasis. Autophagy receptors recognize and recruit specific cargoes to the autophagosome--lysosome pathway for degradation in ubiquitin-dependent and -independent manners, and their functions (in selective autophagy) are regulated by protein modifications, for example, phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Growing evidence has linked the genetic variants of autophagy receptors to neurodegenerative diseases and multiple experimental systems have validated their roles in modulating the disease process. Here, we review the recent advances in understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of autophagy receptors in selective autophagy, and discuss their potentials as therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy receptors designate substrate specificity to autophagy through the recognition of specific cargo, such as aggregated proteins, damaged organelles and foreign pathogens. Accumulation of pathogenic proteins is a common feature of neurodegenerative disorders and dysfunctional autophagy is implicated in the disease state. Disease-associated mutations in autophagy receptors impair signaling in selective autophagy as well as aggregate clearance. Post-translational modification of autophagy receptors regulates the efficiency of aggregate clearance and presents a potential avenue for manipulating autophagy to treat neurodegenerative disease.},

@article{Young2006,
	Abstract = {Autophagy, fundamentally a lysosomal degradation pathway, functions in cells during normal growth and certain pathological conditions, including starvation, to maintain homeostasis. Autophagosomes are formed through a mechanism that is not well understood, despite the identification of many genes required for autophagy. We have studied the mammalian homologue of Atg9p, a multi-spanning transmembrane protein essential in yeast for autophagy, to gain a better understanding of the function of this ubiquitious protein. We show that both the N- and C-termini of mammalian Atg9 (mAtg9) are cytosolic, and predict that mAtg9 spans the membrane six times. We find that mAtg9 is located in the trans-Golgi network and late endosomes and colocalizes with TGN46, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, Rab7 and Rab9. Amino acid starvation or rapamycin treatment, which upregulates autophagy, causes a redistribution of mAtg9 from the TGN to peripheral, endosomal membranes, which are positive for the autophagosomal marker GFP-LC3. siRNA-mediated depletion of the putative mammalian homologue of Atg1p, ULK1, inhibits this starvation-induced redistribution. The redistribution of mAtg9 also requires PI 3-kinase activity, and is reversed after restoration of amino acids. We speculate that starvation-induced autophagy, which requires mAtg9, may rely on an alteration of the steady-state trafficking of mAtg9, in a Atg1-dependent manner.},

	Abstract = {The direct effects of catecholamines on cardiac myocytes may contribute to both normal physiologic adaptation and pathologic remodeling, and may be associated with cellular hypertrophy, apoptosis, and alterations in contractile function. Norepinephrine (NE) signals via alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors (AR) that are coupled to G-proteins. Pharmacologic studies of cardiac myocytes in vitro demonstrate that stimulation of beta1-AR induces apoptosis which is cAMP-dependent and involves the voltage-dependent calcium influx channel. In contrast, stimulation of beta2-AR exerts an anti-apoptotic effect which appears to be mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Stimulation of alpha1-AR causes myocyte hypertrophy and may exert an anti-apoptotic action. In transgenic mice, myocardial overexpression of either beta1-AR or G(alpha)s is associated with myocyte apoptosis and the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. Myocardial overexpression of beta2-AR at low levels results in improved cardiac function, whereas expression at high levels leads to dilated cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of wildtype alpha1B-AR does not result in apoptosis, whereas overexpression of G(alpha)q results in myocyte hypertrophy and/or apoptosis depending on the level of expression. Differential activation of the members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily and production of reactive oxygen species appear to play a key role in mediating the actions of adrenergic pathways on myocyte apoptosis and hypertrophy. This review summarizes current knowledge about the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of cardiac myocyte apoptosis via stimulation of adrenergic receptors and their coupled effector pathways.},

	Abstract = {Autophagy is a conserved process for the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic material. Triggering of autophagy results in the formation of double membrane-bound vesicles termed autophagosomes. The conserved Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 complex is essential for autophagosome formation. Here, we show that the yeast Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 complex directly binds membranes. Membrane binding is mediated by Atg5, inhibited by Atg12 and activated by Atg16. In a fully reconstituted system using giant unilamellar vesicles and recombinant proteins, we reveal that all components of the complex are required for efficient promotion of Atg8 conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine and are able to assign precise functions to all of its components during this process. In addition, we report that in vitro the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 complex is able to tether membranes independently of Atg8. Furthermore, we show that membrane binding by Atg5 is downstream of its recruitment to the pre-autophagosomal structure but is essential for autophagy and cytoplasm-to-vacuole transport at a stage preceding Atg8 conjugation and vesicle closure. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanism of action of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 complex during autophagosome formation. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

	Abstract = {Early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is linked to autosomal dominant mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2) genes. These are critical mediators of total amyloid $\beta$-peptide (A$\beta$) production, inducing cell death through uncertain mechanisms. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) modulates exogenous A$\beta$-induced apoptosis by interfering with E2F-1/p53/Bax. Here, we used mouse neuroblastoma cells that express either wild-type APP, APP with the Swedish mutation (APPswe), or double-mutated human APP and PS1 (APPswe/$\Delta$E9), all exhibiting increased A$\beta$ production and aggregation. Cell viability was decreased in APPswe and APPswe/$\Delta$E9 but was partially reversed by z-VAD.fmk. Nuclear fragmentation and caspase 2, 6 and 8 activation were also readily detected. TUDCA reduced nuclear fragmentation as well as caspase 2 and 6, but not caspase 8 activities. p53 activity, and Bcl-2 and Bax changes, were also modulated by TUDCA. Overexpression of p53, but not mutant p53, in wild-type and mutant neuroblastoma cells was sufficient to induce apoptosis, which, in turn, was reduced by TUDCA. In addition, inhibition of the phosphatidylinositide 3′-OH kinase pathway reduced TUDCA protection against p53-induced apoptosis.

	Abstract = {Oxidative stress has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, antioxidant therapy may represent a promising avenue for the treatment of AD. Edaravone (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one) is a potent free radical scavenger and has been shown to provide neuroprotection in both animal models of cerebral ischemia and stroke patients. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of edaravone against AD-relevant insults in neuroblastoma N2a cells and explored the potential mechanisms involved. N2a/Swe.$\Delta$9 cells were used as the AD model cells, which exhibited reduced cell viability, increased apoptosis and oxidative stress as well as decreased mitochondrial membrane potential compared with N2a/Wt cells. All of these phenotypes were significantly reversed by edaravone treatment. Edaravone treatment significantly elevated cell viability, reduced apoptotic rate, attenuated oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial membrane potential in N2a/Swe.$\Delta$9 cells. Furthermore, edaravone treatment inhibited mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathways in N2a/Swe.$\Delta$9 cells through decreasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, attenuating cytochrome c release and suppressing the activation of caspase-3. These results demonstrate that edaravone provides neuroprotection in an AD-related in vitro model and therefore, may be a potential complement for AD therapy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

@article{Yorimitsu2006,
	Abstract = {Eukaryotic cells have evolved strategies to respond to stress conditions. For example, autophagy in yeast is primarily a response to the stress of nutrient limitation. Autophagy is a catabolic process for the degradation and recycling of cytosolic, long lived, or aggregated proteins and excess or defective organelles. In this study, we demonstrate a new pathway for the induction of autophagy. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), accumulation of misfolded proteins causes stress and activates the unfolded protein response to induce the expression of chaperones and proteins involved in the recovery process. ER stress stimulated the assembly of the pre-autophagosomal structure. In addition, autophagosome formation and transport to the vacuole were stimulated in an Atg protein-dependent manner. Finally, Atg1 kinase activity reflects both the nutritional status and autophagic state of the cell; starvation-induced autophagy results in increased Atg1 kinase activity. We found that Atg1 had high kinase activity during ER stress-induced autophagy. Together, these results indicate that ER stress can induce an autophagic response. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

	Abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that the induction of autophagy by producing therapeutic amounts of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the heart before an ischemic insult would ameliorate/reduce subsequent lethal myocardial ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury (similar to ischemic preconditioning). A dose-response study with both tunicamycin and thapsigargin was performed to determine the optimal dose (0.3{\^{a}}€‰mg/kg) for inducing autophagy for cardioprotection. The Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 300{\^{a}}€‰g were randomly assigned into five groups: normal control (injected with saline only), high (3{\^{a}}€‰mg/kg), and low (0.3{\^{a}}€‰mg/kg) doses of tunicamycin or thapsigargin, respectively. After 48{\^{a}}€‰h, the rats were subjected to an isolated working heart preparation: 30{\^{a}}€‰min ischemia followed by 2{\^{a}}€‰h of reperfusion with continuous left ventricular function monitoring. At the end, the hearts were subjected to either measurement of infarct size or cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Some hearts (from different sets of experiments) were used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confocal microscopy, or Western blot analysis. Tunicamycin and thapsigargin, irrespective of the dose, induced sufficient ER stress, as evidenced by the increased phosphorylation or activation of eIF2$\alpha$ and PERK. Such ER stress potentiated autophagy in the heart, as evidenced by an increase in LC3-II, beclin-1, and Atg5. This was also supported by TEM, clearly showing the production of autophagosomes, and by confocal microscopy, showing upregulation of eIF2$\alpha$ and beclin-1. The autophagy produced with lower doses of tunicamycin and thapsigargin in the face of myocardial I/R resulted in reduction of the I/R injury, as evidenced by improved left ventricular function and reduced myocardial infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In concert, an induction of GRP78 and activation of Akt and Bcl-2 occurred. The higher doses conversely were detrimental for the heart and were associated with induction of CHOP and downregulation of Akt. The results thus display the proof of concept that induction of autophagy by ER stress (therapeutic amount) before ischemia (similar to ischemic preconditioning) could reduce subsequent lethal ischemic reperfusion injury. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	Abstract = {The pathogenesis of sepsis is partly attributable to dysregulated inflammatory response mediated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (for example,endotoxin) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (for example,high-mobility group box 1 [HMGB1]). An endogenous ubiquitous polyamine, spermine, inhibits endotoxin-induced cytokine release in vitro, but its capacities to attenuate sepsis- and HMGB1-induced inflammatory responses was previously unknown.We thus tested the hypothesis that spermine protects mice against lethal sepsis by attenuating sepsis-induced local and systemic inflammatory responses. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of spermine (10 mg/kg, twice daily, for 3 d) conferred a significant protection against lethal sepsis. The protective effects were associated with a significant reduction in peritoneal and serum levels of several surrogate markers of sepsis (for example, Interleukin-6 [IL-6], keratinocyte-derived chemokine [KC], monocytes chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], macrophage inflammatory protein-2 [MIP-2], tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 [TIMP-1], soluble tumor necrosis factor-{\'{a}} receptor I [sTNFRI], and soluble tumor necrosis factor-{\'{a}} receptor II [sTNFRII]) during a late stage of sepsis. In vitro, spermine effectively inhibited HMGB1-induced release of the above surrogate markers in peritoneal macrophages. Thus, spermine confers protection against lethal sepsis partly by attenuating sepsis- and HMGB1-induced inflammatory responses. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research.},

@article{Wu2015,
	Abstract = {Background: Rotenone is an environmental neurotoxin that induces accumulation of $\alpha$-synuclein and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), but the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We investigated whether rotenone induced impairment of autophagic flux and lysosomal functions. Methods: Autophagy flux, accumulation of $\alpha$-synuclein, lysosomal membrane integrity and neurodegeneration were assessed in the rotenone-treated rat model and PC12 cells, and the effects of the autophagy inducer trehalose on rotenone's cytotoxicity were also studied. Results: Rotenone administration significantly reduced motor activity and caused a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase in SNpc of Lewis rats. The degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons was accompanied by the deposition of $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates, autophagosomes and redistribution of cathepsin D from lysosomes to the cytosol. In cultured PC12 cells, rotenone also induced increases in protein levels of $\alpha$-synuclein, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II, Beclin 1, and p62. Rotenone increased lysosomal membrane permeability as evidenced by leakage of N-acetyl-beta- d-glucosaminidase and cathepsin D, the effects were blocked by reactive oxygen species scavenger tiron. Autophagy inducer trehalose enhanced the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB, accelerated the clearance of autophagosomes and $\alpha$-synuclein and attenuated rotenone-induced cell death of PC12 cells. Meanwhile, administration of trehalose to rats in drinking water (2{\%}) decreased rotenone-induced dopaminergic neurons loss in SNpc. Conclusions: These studies indicate that the lysosomal dysfunction contributes to rotenone's neurotoxicity and restoration of lysosomal function could be a new therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) containing plaques and tau-laden neurofibrillary tangles are the defining neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To better mimic this neuropathology, we generated a novel triple transgenic model of AD (3xTg-AD) harboring three mutant genes: $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein ($\beta$APPSwe), presenilin-1 (PS1M146V), and tauP301L. The 3xTg-AD mice progressively develop A$\beta$ and tau pathology, with a temporal- and regional-specific profile that closely mimics their development in the human AD brain. We find that A$\beta$ deposits initiate in the cortex and progress to the hippocampus with aging, whereas tau pathology is first apparent in the hippocampus and then progresses to the cortex. Despite equivalent overexpression of the human $\beta$APP and human tau transgenes, A$\beta$ deposition develops prior to the tangle pathology, consistent with the amyloid cascade hypothesis. As these 3xTg-AD mice phenocopy critical aspects of AD neuropathology, this model will be useful in pre-clinical intervention trials, particularly because the efficacy of anti-AD compounds in mitigating the neurodegenerative effects mediated by both signature lesions can be evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Wills2012,
	Abstract = {SNCA and MAPT genes and environmental factors are important risk factors of Parkinson's disease [PD], the second-most common neurodegenerative disease. The agrichemicals maneb and paraquat selectively target dopaminergic neurons, leading to parkinsonism, through ill-defined mechanisms. In the current studies we have analyzed the ability of maneb and paraquat, separately and together, to induce synucleinopathy and tauopathy in wild type mice. Maneb was ineffective in increasing $\alpha$-synuclein [$\alpha$-Syn] or p-Tau levels. By contrast, paraquat treatment of mice resulted in robust accumulation of $\alpha$-Syn and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in striata, through activation of p-GSK-3$\beta$, a major Tau kinase. Co-treatment with maneb did not enhance the effects of paraquat. Increased hyperacetylation of $\alpha$-tubulin was observed in paraquat-treated mice, suggesting cytoskeleton remodeling. Paraquat, but not maneb, inhibited soluble proteasomal activity on a peptide substrate but this was not associated with a decreased expression of 26S proteasome subunits. Both paraquat and maneb treatments increased levels of the autophagy inhibitor, mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, suggesting impaired axonal autophagy, despite increases in certain autophagic proteins, such as beclin 1 and Agt12. Autophagic flux was also impaired, as ratios of LC3 II to LC3 I were reduced in treated animals. Increased mTOR was also observed in postmortem human PD striata, where there was a reduction in the LC3 II to LC3 I ratio. Heat shock proteins were either increased or unchanged upon paraquat-treatment suggesting that chaperone-mediated autophagy is not hampered by the agrichemicals. These studies provide novel insight into the mechanisms of action of these agrichemicals, which indicate that paraquat is much more toxic than maneb, via its inhibitory effects on proteasomes and autophagy, which lead to accumulation of $\alpha$-Syn and p-Tau.},

	Abstract = {Although the $\beta$-amyloid peptide is an established core component of neuritic plaques that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease, the mechanisms responsible for its deposition are not well understood. We now report that lesions of rat hippocampal neurons cause a time-dependent, long-lasting elevation of immunoreactivity for the $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neighboring astrocytes, a cell type not normally containing the protein. The increase represents astroglial expression of the protein rather than a scavenging of APP released by damaged neurons. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that APP-containing cells are reactive astroglia, both surrounding capillaries and within the neuropil. These results demonstrate that neuronal damage stimulates APP expression in adult brain and suggest that reactive astrocytes may be a source of the $\beta$-amyloid that forms neuropathological plaques in Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

	Abstract = {Biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are currently regarded as indispensable indicators for accurate differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Although high levels of astrocyte-secreted glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) in the CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been reported, the levels of GFAP in the CSF have not been fully investigated in other neurological disorders that cause dementia, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). In this study, we determined the levels of GFAP in the CSF of healthy control (HC) subjects and AD, DLB, and FTLD patients to address two questions: (i) Do the levels of GFAP differ among these disorders? and (ii) Can GFAP be used as a biomarker for the differential diagnosis of these neurodegenerative disorders? The levels of GFAP in AD, DLB, and FTLD patients were significantly higher than those in the HC subjects. Although the levels of GFAP were not significantly different between AD and DLB patients, a higher level of GFAP was observed in FTLD patients than in AD and DLB patients. It is concluded that representative neurological disorders causing dementia were associated with higher levels of GFAP in the CSF. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Chronic neurodegenerative diseases represent major unmet needs for therapeutic interventions. Recently, the neurocentric view of brain function and disease has been challenged by a great number of evidence supporting the physiopathological potential of neuroglia. Astrocytes, in particular, play a pivotal role in brain homeostasis as they actively participate in neuronal metabolism, synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection. Furthermore, they are intrinsic components of brain responses to toxic and traumatic insults through complex processes involving several molecular and functional alterations that may lead to disruption of brain homeostasis and connectivity. This review provides a brief overview of current knowledge of astrocyte functions in the brain, and focuses on some glial-specific pathways involved in astrocytic dysfunction that might be effective therapeutic targets for clinical management of neurodegenerative disorders. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Means and SD of CSF levels of GFAP for the young control group (from 1 to 25 years, mean +/- SD 14.2 +/- 5.0, n = 13) adult control (from 26 to 55 years, 41.6 +/- 10.1, n = 9) and senescent control (older than 56 years, 65.4 +/- 8.0, n = 8) were 2.96 +/- 1.04, 2.80 +/- 1.46 and 3.99 +/- 1.55 ng/ml, respectively, and the CSF level of GFAP was not dependent on age (ANOVA, p = 0.17). While that of the AD patient group (n = 27, 70.8 +/- 8.0 years) was 8.96 +/- 7.80 ng/ml, significantly higher than that of both the all-control (3.19 +/- 1.39 ng/ml, t test, p {\textless} 0.001) and age-matched senescent (3.99 +/- 1.55 ng/ml, t test, p {\textless} 0.005) control groups. The receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the GFAP concentration at 5 ng/ml in CSF could serve as a cutoff value. The CSF level of GFAP in the moderately to severely demented patients (MMSE {\textless}/= 17, 13.2 +/- 9.10 ng/ml, n = 9) was approximately by two-fold higher than that of the mildly to moderately demented patients (MMSE {\textgreater}/= 18, 6.85 +/- 5.76 ng/ml, n = 18; ANOVA, p {\textless} 0.05). These findings together with our previous report on an increase in the CSF level of apolipoprotein E suggest that degeneration and stimulation of astrocytes takes place concurrently in the AD brain.},

	Abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motoneuron disease with no current effective treatment. Accumulation of abnormal protein inclusions containing SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, among other proteins, is a pathological hallmark of ALS. Autophagy is the major degradation pathway involved in the clearance of damaged organelles and protein aggregates. Although autophagy has been shown to efficiently degrade ALS-linked mutant protein in cell culture models, several studies suggest that autophagy impairment may also contribute to disease pathogenesis. In this report, we tested the potential use of trehalose, a disaccharide that induces MTOR-independent autophagy, in the development of experimental ALS. Administration of trehalose to mutant SOD1 transgenic mice significantly prolonged life span and attenuated the progression of disease signs. These effects were associated with decreased accumulation of SOD1 aggregates and enhanced motoneuron survival. The protective effects of trehalose were associated with increased autophagy levels in motoneurons. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that trehalose led to mutant SOD1 degradation by autophagy in NSC34 motoneuron cells and also protected primary motoneurons against the toxicity of conditioned media from mutant SOD1 transgenic astrocytes. At the mechanistic level, trehalose treatment led to a significant upregulation in the expression of key autophagy-related genes at the mRNA level including Lc3, Becn1, Sqstm1 and Atg5. Consistent with these changes, trehalose administration enhanced the nuclear translocation of FOXO1, an important transcription factor involved in the activation of autophagy in neurons. This study suggests a potential use of trehalose and enhancers of MTOR-independent autophagy for the treatment of ALS.},

@article{Kamphuis2012,
	Abstract = {Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is the main astrocytic intermediate filament (IF). GFAP splice isoforms show differential expression patterns in the human brain. GFAP$\delta$ is preferentially expressed by neurogenic astrocytes in the subventricular zone (SVZ), whereas GFAP(+1) is found in a subset of astrocytes throughout the brain. In addition, the expression of these isoforms in human brain material of epilepsy, Alzheimer and glioma patients has been reported. Here, for the first time, we present a comprehensive study of GFAP isoform expression in both wild-type and Alzheimer Disease (AD) mouse models. In cortex, cerebellum, and striatum of wild-type mice, transcripts for Gfap-$\alpha$, Gfap-$\beta$, Gfap-$\gamma$, Gfap-$\delta$, Gfap-$\kappa$, and a newly identified isoform Gfap-$\zeta$, were detected. Their relative expression levels were similar in all regions studied. GFAP$\alpha$ showed a widespread expression whilst GFAP$\delta$ distribution was prominent in the SVZ, rostral migratory stream (RMS), neurogenic astrocytes of the subgranular zone (SGZ), and subpial astrocytes. In contrast to the human SVZ, we could not establish an unambiguous GFAP$\delta$ localization in proliferating cells of the mouse SVZ. In APPswePS1dE9 and 3xTgAD mice, plaque-associated reactive astrocytes had increased transcript levels of all detectable GFAP isoforms and low levels of a new GFAP isoform, Gfap-$\Delta$Ex7. Reactive astrocytes in AD mice showed enhanced GFAP$\alpha$ and GFAP$\delta$ immunolabeling, less frequently increased vimentin and nestin, but no GFAP$\kappa$ or GFAP(+1) staining. In conclusion, GFAP$\delta$ protein is present in SVZ, RMS, and neurogenic astrocytes of the SGZ, but also outside neurogenic niches. Furthermore, differential GFAP isoform expression is not linked with aging or reactive gliosis. This evidence points to the conclusion that differential regulation of GFAP isoforms is not involved in the reorganization of the IF network in reactive gliosis or in neurogenesis in the mouse brain.},

	Abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid plaques are surrounded by reactive astrocytes with an increased expression of intermediate filaments including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Different GFAP isoforms have been identified that are differentially expressed by specific subpopulations of astrocytes and that impose different properties to the intermediate filament network. We studied transcript levels and protein expression patterns of all known GFAP isoforms in human hippocampal AD tissue at different stages of the disease. Ten different transcripts for GFAP isoforms were detected at different abundancies. Transcript levels of most isoforms increased with AD progression. GFAP$\delta$-immunopositive astrocytes were observed in subgranular zone, hilus, and stratum-lacunosum-moleculare. GFAP$\delta$-positive cells also stained for GFAP$\alpha$. In AD donors, astrocytes near plaques displayed increased staining of both GFAP$\alpha$ and GFAP$\delta$. The reading-frame-shifted isoform, GFAP+1, staining was confined to a subset of astrocytes with long processes, and their number increased in the course of AD. In conclusion, the various GFAP isoforms show differential transcript levels and are upregulated in a concerted manner in AD. The GFAP+1 isoform defines a unique subset of astrocytes, with numbers increasing with AD progression. These data indicate the need for future exploration of underlying mechanisms concerning the functions of GFAP$\delta$ and GFAP+1 isoforms in astrocytes and their possible role in AD pathology. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Aim and Background: Spermidine, a naturally occurring polyamine, is involved in various internal biological functions, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. A decreased level of polyamines is associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington disease (HD). 3-Nitropropanoic acid (3-NP) induces a spectrum of HD-like neuropathologies in rat striatum and thus serves as a good experimental model of HD. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether spermidine confers neuroprotection against 3-NP-induced striatal toxicity and to explore its possible mechanism. Methods: Rats were administered 3-NP (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 21 days. Spermidine (5 and 10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) was administered once a day 1 h before 3-NP treatment for 21 days. Body weight and behavioral observations were recorded at weekly intervals after continuous 3-NP treatment. On the 22nd day, the animals were sacrificed, and the rat striatum was isolated for the estimation of biochemical parameters (lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione (GSH), and nitrite), determination of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$ and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1$\beta$), and neurochemical analysis (gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), 5-HT, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine). Results: The findings of the present study demonstrate significant alterations in motor coordination, oxidative defense, and the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6, and IL-1$\beta$) and striatal neurotransmitters upon 3-NP treatment. Pretreatment with spermidine significantly attenuated 3-NP-induced alterations in motor coordination, oxidative stress, and the levels of neuroinflammatory markers and striatal neurotransmitters. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that spermidine exerted a potential neuroprotective effect in a 3-NP model of HD, which may provide insight into the therapeutic potential of spermidine for HD.},

	Abstract = {$\alpha$-Synuclein-containing aggregates represent a feature of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). However, mechanisms that promote intraneuronal $\alpha$-synuclein assembly remain poorly understood. Because pesticides, particularly the herbicide paraquat, have been suggested to play a role as PD risk factors, the hypothesis that interactions between $\alpha$-synuclein and these environmental agents may contribute to aggregate formation was tested in this study. Paraquat markedly accelerated the in vitro rate of $\alpha$-synuclein fibril formation in a dose-dependent fashion. When mice were exposed to the herbicide, brain levels of $\alpha$-synuclein were significantly increased. This up-regulation followed a consistent pattern, with higher $\alpha$-synuclein at 2 days after each of three weekly paraquat injections and with protein levels returning to control values by day 7 post-treatment. Paraquat exposure was also accompanied by aggregate formation. Thioflavine S-positive structures accumulated within neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, and dual labeling and confocal imaging confirmed that these aggregates contained $\alpha$-synuclein. The results suggest that up-regulation of $\alpha$-synuclein as a consequence of toxicant insult and direct interactions between the protein and environmental agents are potential mechanisms leading to $\alpha$-synuclein pathology in neurodegenerative disorders.},

	Abstract = {Paraquat (PQ) is a relatively safe and effective herbicide used all over the world. PQ is very toxic to all living organisms; and many cases of acute poisoning and death have been reported over the past decade. The main suggested potential mechanism for PQ toxicity is the production of superoxide radicals from the metabolism of the PQ by microsomal enzyme systems, and by inducing mitochondrial toxicity. Mitochondria are considered to be a major source of reactive oxygen species in cells and according to this hypothesis, PQ, through suitable oxidation and reduction processes, is able to participate in the redox system in mitochondria. The potential ability of PQ to accept electrons from complex (I, II, III, IV) leads to rapid reaction with molecular oxygen to yield superoxide anion which can lead to the formation of more toxic reactive oxygen species, e.g., hydroxyl radical, often taken as the main toxicant. Lipid peroxidation due to PQ has been implicated in a number of deleterious effects such as increased membrane rigidity, osmotic fragility, decreased mitochondrial components, reduced mitochondrial survival and lipid fluidity. The biological effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is controlled by a wide spectrum of enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense mechanisms such as superoxide dismutas (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione. According to this hypothesis, the chemical cascades lead to the reduction of PQ, which reacts quite rapidly with molecular oxygen to yield superoxide anion. The generation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation are the main factors that lead to mitochondrial damage. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the role of dynamic changes in actin cytoskeleton in cellular response to oxidative stress, we have analyzed the state of actin polymerization and synthesis in human alveolar cells exposed to paraquat, an oxidant agent. Cellular content of monomeric actin was assayed by DNase I inhibition. It decreased significantly in treated cells and depended on paraquat concentration. Paraquat treatment of cells caused an increase of the filamentous pool of actin and a parallel decrease of the monomeric one. Such shift was shown to be irreversible. SDS-PAGE of cytoskeletal fractions was performed under reducing and non-reducing conditions. No cross-linking of actin monomers to form large aggregates appeared to be related to the observed paraquat-induced increase of the filamentous actin pool. Morphological analyses by indirect immunofluorescence and ultrastructural examination confirmed the presence of microfilaments in treated cells. Conventional bundles of filaments were not observed, but numerous single filaments appeared dispersed within the cytoplasm. Pulse-chase experiments showed a strong increase of de novo synthesis of actin in treated cells, whereas actin degradation rate remained unaffected. In conclusion, the different approaches lead to a concordant picture of cellular response to oxidant stress at the level of the actin filament system. Actin pools are modified: the overall number of filaments increases, whereas the monomeric species decreases. As a result of the shift of actin from the monomeric pool to the filamentous one, the de novo synthesis of actin is increased.},

	Abstract = {Environmental toxicants and, in particular, pesticides have been implicated as risk factors in Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of this study was to determine if selective nigrostriatal degeneration could be reproduced by systemic exposure of mice to the widely used herbicide paraquat. Repeated intraperitoneal paraquat injections killed dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta, as assessed by stereological counting of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive and Nissl-stained neurons. This cell loss was dose- and age-dependent. Several lines of evidence indicated selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to paraquat. The number of GABAergic cells was not decreased in the SN pars reticulata, and counting of Nissl-stained neurons in the hippocampus did not reveal any change in paraquat-treated mice. Degenerating cell bodies were observed by silver staining, but only in the SN pars compacta, and glial response was present in the ventral mesencephalon but not in the frontal cortex and cerebellum. No significant depletion of striatal dopamine followed paraquat administration. On the other hand, enhanced dopamine synthesis was suggested by an increase in TH activity. These findings unequivocally show that selective dopaminergic degeneration, one of the pathological hallmarks of PD, is also a characteristic of paraquat neurotoxicity. The apparent discrepancy between pathological (i.e., neurodegeneration) and neurochemical (i.e., lack of significant dopamine loss) effects represents another important feature of this paraquat model and is probably a reflection of compensatory mechanisms by which neurons that survive damage are capable of restoring neurotransmitter tissue levels. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

@article{McCormack2005,
	Abstract = {Systemic treatment of mice with the herbicide paraquat causes the selective loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, reproducing the primary neurodegenerative feature of Parkinson's disease. To elucidate the role of oxidative damage in paraquat neurotoxicity, the time-course of neurodegeneration was correlated to changes in 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), a lipid peroxidation marker. When mice were exposed to three weekly injections of paraquat, no nigral dopaminergic cell loss was observed after the first administration, whereas a significant reduction of neurons followed the second exposure. Changes in the number of nigral 4-HNE-positive neurons suggest a relationship between lipid peroxidation and neuronal death, since a dramatic increase in this number coincided with the onset and development of neurodegeneration after the second toxicant injection. Interestingly, the third paraquat administration did not cause any increase in 4-HNE-immunoreactive cells, nor did it produce any additional dopaminergic cell loss. Further evidence of paraquat-induced oxidative injury derives from the observation of nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra of paraquat-treated animals and from experiments with ferritin transgenic mice. These mice, which are characterized by a decreased susceptibility to oxidative stress, were completely resistant to the increase in 4-HNE-positive neurons and the cell death caused by paraquat. Thus, paraquat exposure yields a model that emphasizes the susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons to oxidative damage.},

@article{Marino2014,
	Abstract = {Nutrient depletion, which is one of the physiological triggers of autophagy, results in the depletion of intracellular acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) coupled to the deacetylation of cellular proteins. We surmise that there are 3 possibilities to mimic these effects, namely (i) the depletion of cytosolic AcCoA by interfering with its biosynthesis, (ii) the inhibition of acetyltransferases, which are enzymes that transfer acetyl groups from AcCoA to other molecules, mostly leucine residues in cellular proteins, or (iii) the stimulation of deacetylases, which catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from leucine residues. There are several examples of rather nontoxic natural compounds that act as AcCoA depleting agents (e.g., hydroxycitrate), acetyltransferase inhibitors (e.g., anacardic acid, curcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, garcinol, spermidine) or deacetylase activators (e.g., nicotinamide, resveratrol), and that are highly efficient inducers of autophagy in vitro and in vivo, in rodents. Another common characteristic of these agents is their capacity to reduce aging-associated diseases and to confer protective responses against ischemia-induced organ damage. Hence, we classify them as "caloric restriction mimetics" (CRM). Here, we speculate that CRM may mediate their broad health-improving effects by triggering the same molecular pathways that usually are elicited by long-term caloric restriction or short-term starvation and that imply the induction of autophagy as an obligatory event conferring organismal, organ- or cytoprotection.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc. PURPOSE. To assess the therapeutic potential of spermidine in mice with excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) deletion (EAAC1 knockout [KO] mice), a mouse model of normal tension glaucoma. METHODS. Spermidine, at 30 mM in drinking water, was administered to EAAC1 KO mice from 5 to 12 weeks old. Optical coherence tomography, multifocal electroretinograms, and the measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) were performed at 5, 8, and 12 weeks old. Histopathology analyses were carried out at 8 and 12 weeks old, and immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) in the retina were performed at 8 weeks old. RESULTS. Spermidine ameliorated retinal degeneration and improved visual function in EAAC1 KO mice at both 8 and 12 weeks old, without affecting IOP. A significant increase of 4-HNE was observed in vehicle-treated EAAC1 KO mice, but spermidine treatment reduced this increase, suggesting that spermidine alleviated the severity of the glaucoma-like phenotype by acting as an antioxidant. CONCLUSIONS. The results from this study suggest that oral spermidine administration could be a useful treatment for retinal degenerative disorders including glaucoma.},

	Abstract = {1. Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the world, and there is a clear need to develop new therapeutics for the stroke victim. To address this need, we generated a combinatorial library of polyamine compounds based on sFTX-3.3 toxin from which L-Arginyl-3,4-Spermidine (L-Arg-3,4) emerged as a lead neuroprotective compound. In the present study, we have extended earlier results to examine the compound's neuroprotective actions in greater detail. 2. In an in vitro ischaemia model, L-Arg-3,4 significantly reduced CA1 cell death when administered prior to induction of 60 min of ischaemia as well as when administered immediately after ischaemia. Surprisingly, L-Arg-3,4 continued to prevent cell death significantly when administration was delayed for as long as 60 min after ischaemia. 3. L-Arg-3,4 significantly reduced cell death in excitotoxicity models mediated by glutamate, NMDA, AMPA, or kainate. Unlike glutamate receptor antagonists, 300 microM L-Arg-3,4 did not suppress synaptic transmission as measured by evoked responses in acute hippocampal slices. 4. L-Arg-3,4 provided significant protection, in vitro, in a superoxide mediated injury model and prevented an increase of superoxide production after AMPA or NMDA stimulation. It also decreased nitric oxide production after in vitro ischaemia and NMDA stimulation, but did so without inhibiting nitric oxide synthase directly. 5. Furthermore, L-Arg-3,4 was significantly neuroprotective in an in vivo model of global forebrain ischaemia, without any apparent neurological side-effects. 6. Taken together, these results demonstrate that L-Arg-3,4 is protective in several models of neurodegeneration and may have potential as a new therapeutic compound for the treatment of stroke, trauma, and other neurodegenerative diseases.},

Here, we present an optimized scanning electron microscopy (SEM) workflow for volumetric array tomography for asymmetric samples and model organisms (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio). We modified a diamond knife to simplify serial section array acquisition with minimal artifacts. After array acquisition, the arrays were transferred to a glass coverslip or silicon wafer support. Using light microscopy, the arrays were screened rapidly for initial recognition of global anatomical features (organs or body traits). Then, using SEM, an in-depth study of the cells and/or organs of interest was performed. Our manual and automatic data acquisition strategies make 3D data acquisition and correlation simpler and more precise than alternative methods. This method can be used to address questions in cell and developmental biology that require the efficient identification of a labeled cell or organelle.},

	Abstract = {High-resolution imaging of autophagy has been used intensively in cell culture studies, but so far it has been difficult to visualize this process in detail in whole animal models. In this study we present a versatile method for high-resolution imaging of microbial infection in zebrafish larvae by injecting pathogens into the tail fin. This allows visualization of autophagic compartments by light and electron microscopy, which makes it possible to correlate images acquired by the 2 techniques. Using this method we have studied the autophagy response against Mycobacterium marinum infection. We show that mycobacteria during the progress of infection are frequently associated with GFP-Lc3-positive vesicles, and that 2 types of GFP-Lc3-positive vesicles were observed. The majority of these vesicles were approximately 1 $\mu$m in size and in close vicinity of bacteria, and a smaller number of GFP-Lc3-positive vesicles was larger in size and were observed to contain bacteria. Quantitative data showed that these larger vesicles occurred significantly more in leukocytes than in other cell types, and that approximately 70{\%} of these vesicles were positive for a lysosomal marker. Using electron microscopy, it was found that approximately 5{\%} of intracellular bacteria were present in autophagic vacuoles and that the remaining intracellular bacteria were present in phagosomes, lysosomes, free inside the cytoplasm or occurred as large aggregates. Based on correlation of light and electron microscopy images, it was shown that GFP-Lc3-positive vesicles displayed autophagic morphology. This study provides a new approach for injection of pathogens into the tail fin, which allows combined light and electron microscopy imaging in vivo and opens new research directions for studying autophagy process related to infectious diseases. {\textcopyright} 2014 Landes Bioscience.},

	Abstract = {Cryo-soft X-ray tomography (cryo-SXT) is a powerful imaging technique that can extract ultrastructural information from whole, unstained mammalian cells as close to the living state as possible. Subcellular organelles including the nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria have been identified by morphology alone, due to the similarity in contrast to transmission electron micrographs. In this study, we used cryo-SXT to image endosomes and autophagosomes, organelles that are particularly susceptible to chemical fixation artefacts during sample preparation for electron microscopy. We used two approaches to identify these compartments. For early and recycling endosomes, which are accessible to externally-loaded markers, we used an anti-transferrin receptor antibody conjugated to 10. nm gold particles. For autophagosomes, which are not accessible to externally-applied markers, we developed a correlative cryo-fluorescence and cryo-SXT workflow (cryo-CLXM) to localise GFP-LC3 and RFP-Atg9. We used a stand-alone cryo-fluorescence stage in the home laboratory to localise the cloned fluorophores, followed by cryo-soft X-ray tomography at the synchrotron to analyse cellular ultrastructure. We mapped the 3D ultrastructure of the endocytic and autophagic structures, and discovered clusters of omegasomes arising from 'hotspots' on the ER. Thus, immunogold markers and cryo-CLXM can be used to analyse cellular processes that are inaccessible using other imaging modalities. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

Unfortunately, this method lacks the ultrastructural information about the structure of interest (SOI). Currently, electron microscopy (EM) is the best tool to achieve highest spatial resolution. In addition, correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) analysis of the same structure allows combining authentic live cell imaging with the resolution power of EM. Additionally the reference space of the SOI is revealed. Our CLEM analyses of HeLa cells allow tracing the morphology and dynamic behavior of intracellular micro-compartments in living cells and their ultrastructure and subcellular organization in a highly resolved manner.},

	Abstract = {Autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates is important for cell survival, but it is not known how the autophagic machinery recognizes such aggregates. In this study, we report that polymerization of the polyubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1 yields protein bodies that either reside free in the cytosol and nucleus or occur within autophagosomes and lysosomal structures. Inhibition of autophagy led to an increase in the size and number of p62 bodies and p62 protein levels. The autophagic marker light chain 3 (LC3) colocalized with p62 bodies and co-immunoprecipitated with p62, suggesting that these two proteins participate in the same complexes. The depletion of p62 inhibited recruitment of LC3 to autophagosomes under starvation conditions. Strikingly, p62 and LC3 formed a shell surrounding aggregates of mutant huntingtin. Reduction of p62 protein levels or interference with p62 function significantly increased cell death that was induced by the expression of mutant huntingtin. We suggest that p62 may, via LC3, be involved in linking polyubiquitinated protein aggregates to the autophagy machinery.},

	Abstract = {Spermidine, a natural polyamine presented widely in mammalian cells, has been implicated to extend the lifespan of several model organisms by inducing autophagy. However, the effect of spermidine against neuronal damage has not yet been fully determined. In this study, neuronal cell injury was induced by treating PC12 cells and cortical neurons with 1 $\mu$M staurosporine (STS). We found that STS-induced cell injury could be efficiently attenuated by pretreatment with 1 mM spermidine. Spermidine inhibited the caspase 3 activation induced by STS. Moreover, STS incubation resulted in autophagic degradation failure, which could be attenuated by the pretreatment of spermidine. Knocking down the expression of Beclin 1 efficiently suppressed autophagosome and autolysosome accumulation, and abolished the protective effects of spermidine against STS-induced neurotoxicity. Increased Beclin 1 cleavage and partial nuclear translocation of Beclin 1 fragment was detected in STS-treated cells, which could be blocked by spermidine, pan-caspase inhibitor or caspase 3-specific inhibitor. The nuclear translocation of Beclin 1 fragment universally occurs in damaged neurons. Beclin 1 mutation at the sites of 146 and 149 prevented the intracellular re-distribution of Beclin 1 induced by STS. In addition, intraperitoneal injection of spermidine ameliorated ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal injury in the hippocampus and cortex of rats, possibly via blocking caspase 3 activation and consequent Beclin 1 cleavage. Our findings suggest that caspase 3-mediated Beclin 1 cleavage occurs in acute neuronal cell injury both in vitro and in vivo. The neuroprotective effect of spermidine may be related to inhibition of the caspase 3-mediated Beclin 1 cleavage and restoration of the Beclin 1-dependent autophagy.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autophagy is a dynamic process during which isolation membranes package substrates to form autophagosomes that are fused with lysosomes to form autolysosomes for degradation. Although it is agreed that the LC3II-associated mature autophagosomes move along microtubular tracks, it is still in dispute if the conversion of LC3I to LC3II before autophagosomes are fully mature and subsequent fusion of mature autophagosomes with lysosomes require microtubules.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We use biochemical markers of autophagy and a collection of microtubule interfering reagents to test the question. Results show that interruption of microtubules with either microtubule stabilizing paclitaxel or destabilizing nocodazole similarly impairs the conversion of LC3I to LC3II, but does not block the degradation of LC3II-associated autophagosomes. Acetylation of microtubules renders them resistant to nocodazole treatment. Treatment with vinblastine that causes depolymerization of both non-acetylated and acetylated microtubules results in impairment of both LC3I-LC3II conversion and LC3II-associated autophagosome fusion with lysosomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Acetylated microtubules are required for fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolysosomes.},

	Abstract = {Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is activated by various types of stress, including, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ER stress-induced ASK1 activation could play an important role both in neuronal apoptosis and an autophagic response in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease. The mechanism by which ASK1 executes apoptosis and/or autophagy under ER stress is still unclear. We have addressed this question using SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing wild-type (WT) ASK1. We show an important autophagic response and an acceleration of the paraquat (PQ)-induced autophagy with hallmarks as accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, activation of beclin-1, accumulation of LC3 II, p62 degradation, and mammalian target of rapamycin dephosphorylation. Inhibition of autophagy caused an exacerbation of the apoptosis induced by WT ASK1 overexpression with or without PQ. These data support the idea that the autophagic response could have a protector role. We found also an increase in the phosphorylation of the proteins such as IRE1 and eIF2$\alpha$ in response to both the overexpression of WT ASK1 and pesticide exposure. These data suggest that the WT ASK1 overexpression-induced autophagy is an event that occurs in parallel with ER stress activation. The importance of ER stress in the autophagy induced by ASK1 and/or PQ was confirmed with salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of eIF2$\alpha$ dephosphorylation. In conclusion, we report that PQ induces an early ER stress response that is correlated with the activation of autophagy as a protective response, which is accelerated in cells that overexpress WT ASK1. However, when the toxic stimuli remain, the cell eventually succumbs to apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {The role of autophagy as a survival strategy of cells constitutes an emerging topic in the study of the pathogenesis of several diseases with autophagic changes being described in a number of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the etiology of PD is still unknown, both environmental (for example, paraquat exposure) and genetic factors have been investigated as putative causes of the disease. In the latter case, mutations or changes in the protein DJ-1 have been reported to be associated with autosomal recessive, early-onset parkinsonism. In this paper we established a model system to study the involvement of the DJ-1 protein in paraquat-induced autophagy. When human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with DJ-1-specific small interfering RNAs and exposed to paraquat, we observed (i) sensitization additive with paraquat-induced apoptotic cell death, (ii) inhibition of the cytoplasmic accumulation of autophagic vacuoles as well as the recruitment of LC3 fusion protein to the vacuoles, (iii) exacerbation of apoptotic cell death in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine, and (iv) an increase in mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings suggest an active role for DJ-1 in the autophagic response produced by paraquat, providing evidence for the role of PD-related proteins in the autophagic degradation pathway, a factor that should be considered in the design of potential therapies for the treatment of the disease. ? 2009 International Society for Neurochemistry.},

	Abstract = {Autophagy is a degradative mechanism involved in the recycling and turnover of cytoplasmic constituents from eukaryotic cells. This phenomenon of autophagy has been observed in neurons from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting a functional role for autophagy in neuronal cell death. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that exposure to pesticides can be a risk factor in the incidence of PD. In this sense, paraquat (PQ) (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride), a widely used herbicide that is structurally similar to the known dopaminergic neurotoxicant MPP(+) (1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridine), has been suggested as a potential etiologic factor for the development of PD. The current study shows, for the first time, that low concentrations of PQ induce several characteristics of autophagy in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In this way, PQ induced the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in the cytoplasm and the recruitment of a LC3-GFP fusion protein to AVs. Furthermore, the cells treated with PQ showed an increase of the long-lived protein degradation which is blocked in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Finally, the cells succumbed to cell death with hallmarks of apoptosis such as phosphatidylserine exposure, caspase activation, and chromatin condensation. While caspase inhibition retarded cell death, autophagy inhibition accelerated the apoptotic cell death induced by PQ. Altogether, these findings show the relationship between autophagy and apoptotic cell death in human neuroblastoma cells treated with PQ.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE. To assess the effects of spermidine on the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), with a focus on optic neuritis often associated with MS and EAE. METHODS. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced EAE mice were administered with or without spermidine at 30 mM in drinking water for 25 days. Clinical signs of EAE were scored daily, and visual functions were measured by multifocal electroretinograms. Histopathology analysis of the spinal cord and optic nerve was performed after mice were killed on day 25. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) was detected using the probe 2'-7' dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) in the optic nerve. The effect of spermidine on H 2 O 2 -induced retinal ganglion cell apoptosis was investigated by lactate dehydrogenase assay. RESULTS. Daily clinical scoring revealed that the severity of EAE was significantly attenuated in the spermidine-treated group, which was confirmed by milder demyelination and improved axon survival in the spinal cord of spermidine-treated mice. Visual functions were significantly improved in spermidinetreated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. Spermidine treatment ameliorated the extent of demyelination in the optic nerve and prevented cell loss in the retinal ganglion cell layer. Furthermore, fewer DCFDA-labeled cells were found in the optic nerve in the spermidine-treated EAE mice, and in vitro analysis revealed that spermidine reduced H 2 O 2 -induced retinal ganglion cell apoptosis, suggesting that spermidine alleviated the severities of EAE, particularly of optic neuritis, by acting as an antioxidant. CONCLUSIONS. The results from this study suggest that oral spermidine administration could be a useful treatment for MS. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Paraquat is a herbicide with a potential risk to induce parkinsonism due to its demonstrated neurotoxicity and its strong structural similarity to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), a well-known neurotoxin which causes a clinical syndrome similar to Parkinson's disease (PD). However, at present very little is known about the signaling pathways activated by paraquat in any cell system. In this study, we have investigated the effect of paraquat on extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and protein kinase B (PKB) activation in E18 cells. Low concentrations of paraquat stimulated very early increases in ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and PKB phosphorylation. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002 (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) inhibited early paraquat-induced increases in PKB phosphorylation. Furthermore, early paraquat-mediated increases in ERK1/2 activation were sensitive to the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor PD 98059 (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone), whereas JNK1/2 responses were blocked by the JNK1/2 inhibitor SP 600125 (anthra[1-9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one). Pretreatment with wortmannin, LY 294002, or PD 98059 had no effect on paraquat cell death in E18 cells. In contrast, SP 600125 significantly decreased paraquat-induced cell death in E18 cells. In conclusion, we have shown that low concentrations of paraquat stimulate robust very early increases in ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and PKB phosphorylation in E18 cells. Furthermore, the data presented clearly suggest that inhibition of the JNK1/2 pathway protects E18 cells from paraquat-induced cell death and support the fact that inhibition of early activation of JNK1/2 can constitute a potential strategy in PD treatment.},

	Abstract = {We examined the toxicity of paraquat, a possible environmental risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD). Paraquat is structurally similar to the neurotoxin MPP+ that can induce Parkinsonian-like features in rodents, non-human primates and human. Exposure of cerebellar granule cells to relatively low concentrations of paraquat (5 $\mu$M) produces apoptotic cell death with a reduction in mitochondrial cytochrome c content, proteolytic activation and caspase-3 activity increase and DNA fragmentation. Paraquat-induced apoptosis was significantly attenuated by co-treatment of cerebellar granule cells with the radical scavenger vitamin E, suggesting that paraquat-induced free radicals serve as important signal in initiation of cell death. As a decrease in mitochondrial cytochrome c content is also prevented by allopurinol, we suggest that xanthine oxidase plays an important role in the free radical production that precedes the apoptotic cascade and cell death after paraquat exposition. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Recent etiological study in twins (Tanner et al. 1999) strongly suggests that environmental factors play an important role in typical, non-familial Parkinson's disease (PD), beginning after age 50. Epidemiological risk factor analyses of typical PD cases have identified several neurotoxicants, including MPP(+) (the active metabolite of MPTP), paraquat, dieldrin, manganese and salsolinol. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these neurotoxic agents might induce cell death in our nigral dopaminergic cell line, SN4741 (Son et al. 1999) through a common molecular mechanism. Our initial experiments revealed that treatment with both MPP(+) and the other PD-related neurotoxicants induced apoptotic cell death in SN4741 cells, following initial increases of H(2)O(2)-related ROS activity and subsequent activation of JNK1/2 MAP kinases. Moreover, we have demonstrated that during dopaminergic cell death cascades, MPP(+), the neurotoxicants and an oxidant, H(2)O(2) equally induce the ROS-dependent events. Remarkably, the oxidant treatment alone induced similar sequential molecular events: ROS increase, activation of JNK MAP kinases, activation of the PITSLRE kinase, p110, by both Caspase-1 and Caspase-3-like activities and apoptotic cell death. Pharmacological intervention using the combination of the antioxidant Trolox and a pan-caspase inhibitor Boc-(Asp)-fmk (BAF) exerted significant neuroprotection against ROS-induced dopaminergic cell death. Finally, the high throughput cDNA microarray screening using the current model identified downstream response genes, such as heme oxygenase-1, a constituent of Lewy bodies, that can be the useful biomarkers to monitor the pathological conditions of dopaminergic neurons under neurotoxic insult.},

	Abstract = {Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are important aspects of pathogenesis, particularly in the brain, which is highly dependent on oxygen, and the protection of astrocytes is essential for neuroprotection. In this context, imidazoline drugs have been reported to be neuroprotective. Our recent study showed that imidazoline drugs, including guanabenz, inhibit the naphthazarin-induced oxidative cytotoxicity associated with lysosomal destabilization. We now report on a study into the protective effects of rilmenidine and AGN 192403, which have affinity for imidazoline-1 receptors, on the cytotoxicity induced by naphthazarin and inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration in astrocytes. Cytotoxicity was measured grossly by LDH release and by measuring changes in lysosomal membrane stability and features of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Naphthazarin-induced cytotoxicity was evidenced by the ordered development of lysosomal acridine orange relocation, decrease in mitochondrial potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 activation, and was inhibited by guanabenz, rilmenidine, and AGN 192403. Antimycin A and rotenone induced mitochondrial dysfunction primarily, and their cytotoxicities were inhibited only by AGN 192403. Rilmenidine and guanabenz may have a lysosomal stabilizing effect, which underlies their protective effects. AGN 192403 might affect the mitochondrial cell death cascades, and had a novel protective effect on the cytotoxicity associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.},

	Abstract = {Polyamines (PAs) are indispensable polycations ubiquitous to all living cells. Among their many critical functions, PAs contribute to the oxidative balance of the cell. Beginning with studies by the Tabor laboratory in bacteria and yeast, the requirement for PAs as protectors against oxygen radical-mediated damage has been well established in many organisms, including mammals. However, PAs also serve as substrates for oxidation reactions that produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) both intra- and extracellularly. As intracellular concentrations of PAs can reach millimolar concentrations, the H2O2 amounts produced through their catabolism, coupled with a reduction in protective PAs, are sufficient to cause the oxidative damage associated with many pathologies, including cancer. Thus, the maintenance of intracellular polyamine homeostasis may ultimately contribute to the maintenance of oxidative homeostasis. Again, pioneering studies by Tabor and colleagues led the way in first identifying spermine oxidase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They also first purified the extracellular bovine serum amine oxidase and elucidated the products of its oxidation of primary amine groups of PAs when included in culture medium. These investigations formed the foundation for many polyamine-related studies and experimental procedures still performed today. This Minireview will summarize key innovative studies regarding PAs and oxidative damage, starting with those from the Tabor laboratory and including the most recent advances, with a focus on mammalian systems.},

	Abstract = {Environmental exposure to paraquat has been reported to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). In experimental animal models paraquat reproduces features of PD, however, the exact mechanism of PD-induced neurotoxicity has not been fully established. This study was designed to investigate paraquat-mediated interference with mitochondrial function and autophagy, and determine the impact of the modulation of autophagy flux on paraquat-induced cell toxicity. Rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were treated with paraquat for 24 h to establish a cellular mode of PD induced neurotoxicity. Pre-incubation of PC12 cells with an antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or autophagy modulators rapamycin and chloroquine was conducted to determine the effect of modulation of oxidative status and autophagy flux on paraquat-elicited cytotoxicity. Mitochondrial functions and dynamics were analyzed by measuring oxygen consumption in a high-resolution oxygraph and imaging with a fluorescent mitochondrial dye (MitoTracker). Reactive oxygen species was determined by flow cytometry using fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. Autophagic flux was determined by Western blot analysis of autophagy marker LC3-II as well as p62 expression. It was found that treatment of cells with paraquat caused a concentration-dependent loss of cell viability that was accompanied by a decrease in cell respiration and reduction of polarized mitochondria, which was prevented by pretreatment of cells with NAC. Analysis of autophagy showed that NAC inhibited basic autophagy flux of PC12 cells, as evidenced by a decrease in LC3-II level and an increase in p62 expression. However, this modulation of autophagy by NAC may not be implicated into its cellular protective mechanism over paraquat cytotoxicity as inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine significantly enhanced paraquat induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the autophagy inducer rapamycin dramatically decreased paraquat induced cellular toxicity in PC12 cells. The present study demonstrates that basal autophagy plays a protective role in paraquat-induced cell toxicity. Antioxidant NAC confers protective role in paraquat toxicity mainly through maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and function, other than a modulation of autophagy flux.},

	Abstract = {The polyamines spermidine and spermine have been hypothesized to possess different functions in the protection of DNA from reactive oxygen species. The growth and survival of mouse fibroblasts unable to synthesize spermine were compared to their normal counterparts in their native and polyamine-depleted states in response to oxidative stress. The results of these studies suggest that when present at normal or supraphysiological concentrations, either spermidine or spermine can protect cells from reactive oxygen species. However, when polyamine pools are pharmacologically manipulated to produce cells with low levels of predominately spermine or spermidine, spermine appears to be more effective. Importantly, when cells are depleted of both glutathione and endogenous polyamines, they exhibit increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide as compared to glutathione depletion alone, suggesting that polyamines not only play a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress but this role is distinct from that played by glutathione.},

NADPH-DQ reductase activity in brain Ms was 2.5-fold higher than NADPH-PQ reductase activity. The formation of PQ and DQ radicals was verified optically and observed directly by ESR spectroscopy in the NADPH-PQ and -DQ reductase reactions by brain Ms under anaerobic conditions. PQ- and DQ-induced superoxide formation was confirmed by the detection of DMPO-OOH ESR signals and followed by chemiluminescence (CL) of a Cypridina luciferin analogue (CLA). The kinetics and intensity of the CL were consistent with the observations that the reduction in DQ is faster than that in PQ. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and phospholipid hydroperoxides in brain Ms increased in the presence of NADPH and Fe3+. The generation of both lipid peroxidation products derived from brain Ms decreased with increasing concentrations of PQ and DQ. The inhibitory effect of DQ is more pronounced than that of PQ. The formation of PQ- and DQ-induced reactive oxygen species was not associated with lipid peroxidation in rat brain Ms.},

	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: USES: Diquat (1,1'-ethylene-2,2'-bipyridilium) is a nonselective bipyridyl herbicide, related structurally to paraquat, which is used both as a contact herbicide and a preharvest desiccant. In comparison to paraquat, diquat is used much less widely in agriculture. MECHANISMS OF TOXICITY: Diquat is a potent redox cycler and is readily converted to a free radical which, in reaction with molecular oxygen, generates superoxide anions and subsequently other redox products. These products can induce lipid peroxidation in cell membranes, and potentially cause cell death. FEATURES: Over the period 1968-1999, only 30 cases of diquat poisoning were reported in detail in the literature, of which 13 (43{\%}) were fatal. Local and systemic effects have been reported following diquat exposure, with systemic features being invariably associated with ingestion. In severe and usually fatal cases, gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration, paralytic ileus, hypovolemic shock, acute renal failure, and coma have been reported. MANAGEMENT: After rapid confirmation of the diagnosis using a qualitative urine test, gut decontamination may be considered in patients who present within 1 hour of a life-threatening ingestion ({\textgreater}6 g). Supportive measures including fluid and electrolyte replacement should then be employed. Although hemofiltration and hemodialysis are of proven value if renal failure supervenes, there is no clinical evidence that hemodialysis or hemoperfusion removes toxicologically significant amounts of diquat, thereby reducing the risk of organ failure and preventing a fatal outcome in severe cases.},

	Abstract = {Paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride) is widely used as a redox cycler to stimulate superoxide production in organisms, cells, and mitochondria. This superoxide production causes extensive mitochondrial oxidative damage, however, there is considerable uncertainty over the mitochondrial sites of paraquat reduction and superoxide formation. Here we show that in yeast and mammalian mitochondria, superoxide production by paraquat occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, as inferred from manganese superoxide dismutase-sensitive mitochondrial DNA damage, as well as from superoxide assays in isolated mitochondria, which were unaffected by exogenous superoxide dismutase. This paraquat-induced superoxide production in the mitochondrial matrix required a membrane potential that was essential for paraquat uptake into mitochondria. This uptake was of the paraquat dication, not the radical monocation, and was carrier-mediated. Experiments with disrupted mitochondria showed that once in the matrix paraquat was principally reduced by complex I (mammals) or by NADPH dehydrogenases (yeast) to form the paraquat radical cation that then reacted with oxygen to form superoxide. Together this membrane potential-dependent uptake across the mitochondrial inner membrane and the subsequent rapid reduction to the paraquat radical cation explain the toxicity of paraquat to mitochondria.},

Our study evaluated the effect of subchronic PQ exposure on the neuropathology, genotoxicity, and antioxidant activity on the nervous tissue of Drosophila melanogaster. We also explored the behavioral effect of PQ on D. melanogaster. Furthermore, we attempted to validate the mechanism by evaluating PQ-induced cytotoxicity on the D-Mel2 cell lines. The fruit fly D. melanogaster serves as a feasible model to understand the mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases. Our study shows a dose-dependent PQ-induced neuropathology in the brain tissue of D. melanogaster as evidenced by hematoxylin and eosin staining, silver nitrate staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Electron microscopic study of D. melanogaster brain tissue exhibited vacuolar degeneration and significant neuronal damage across the nervous tissue structure in comparison with control. Our findings also indicate a dose-dependent locomotor impairment and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) specific activity in PQ-treated D. melanogaster. These PQ-induced neuroanatomical changes and decreased SOD specific activity showed a significant association with oxidative DNA damage as observed by alkaline comet assay. Additionally, we show, for the first time, a dose-dependent PQ-induced cytotoxicity in the D-Mel2 cells suggesting loss of neuronal cell viability via cytotoxic damage. Our data suggest that PQ exposure results in neurodegeneration in D. melanogaster and that fruit fly is a suitable in vivo model for correlating the neuroanatomical changes with neurotoxic damages to nervous system.},

	Abstract = {Paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium chloride; PQ) is widely and commonly used as a herbicides in the world. PQ has been reported to be a major hazard because it causes lung injury. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PQ-induced lung toxicity still need to be elucidated. Here, we found that PQ significantly decreases cell viability, increases sub-G1 hypodiploids DNA contents and caspase 3/7 activity in lung alveolar epithelial cell-derived L2 cells, which also caused mitochondrial dysfunction, and decreased the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and increased that of Bax, Bak, and p53. Moreover, the protein expressions of Bax and Bak were increased in PQ-treated cells. In addition, when PQ was exposed to L2 cells, the expressions of ER stress-related signaling genes (including Grp78, CHOP, and caspase-12 mRNA) and proteins (including phospho-eIF-2$\alpha$, CHOP, Grp78, calpain I and -II, and caspase-12) were significantly increased. PQ also decreased the protein expressions of pro-caspase-9/7/3. Next, we investigated the role of Nrf-2 in PQ-induced alveolar epithelial cell toxicity. In L2 cells, PQ induced Nrf-2 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. Cells transfected with Nrf-2 siRNA significantly reversed the PQ-induced toxicity, including depolarization of MMP, increased the Bax, Bak, p53 mRNAs expression, decreased the Bcl-2 mRNA expression, increased the caspase 3/7 activity, Grp78, CHOP, and caspase-12 mRNAs and protein expression, and decreased that of pro-caspase-3. Taken together, these results suggest that Nrf-2-regulated mitochondria and ER stress-related pathways are involved in the PQ-induced alveolar epithelial cell injury.},

	Abstract = {Paraquat is a neurotoxic agent, and oxidative stress plays an important role in neuronal cell death after paraquat exposure. In this study, we assessed the neuroprotective effect of curcumin against paraquat and explored the underlying mechanisms of curcumin in vitro. Curcumin treatment prevented paraquat-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptotic cell death. Curcumin also exerted a neuroprotective effect by increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic and antioxidant genes. The pretreatment of curcumin significantly decreased gene expression and protein production of amyloid precursor protein. The activation of autophagy process was found defective in paraquat-induced cells, indicated by the accumulation and reduction of LC3I/II. Noteworthy, curcumin restored LC3I/II expression after the pretreatment. Collectively, curcumin demonstrated as a prominent suppressor of ROS, and could reverse autophagy induction in SH-SY5Y cells. The consequences of this were the reduction of APP production and prevention of SH-SY5Y cells from apoptosis. Altogether, curcumin potentially serves as a therapeutic agent of neurodegenerative diseases, associated with ROS overproduction and autophagy dysfunction.},

	Abstract = {Spermidine is a ubiquitous polycation that is synthesized from putrescine and serves as a precursor of spermine. Putrescine, spermidine and spermine all are polyamines that participate in multiple known and unknown biological processes. Exogenous supply of spermidine prolongs the life span of several model organisms including yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) and flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and significantly reduces age-related oxidative protein damage in mice, indicating that this agent may act as a universal anti-aging drug. Spermidine induces autophagy in cultured yeast and mammalian cells, as well as in nematodes and flies. Genetic inactivation of genes essential for autophagy abolishes the life span-prolonging effect of spermidine in yeast, nematodes and flies. These findings complement expanding evidence that autophagy mediates cytoprotection against a variety of noxious agents and can confer longevity when induced at the whole-organism level. We hypothesize that increased autophagic turnover of cytoplasmic organelles or long-lived proteins is involved in most if not all life span-prolonging therapies.},

While synaptic plasticity promotes memory formation, the etiology of age-induced memory formation remained enigmatic. Previous work showed that simple feeding of polyamine spermidine protects from age-induced memory impairment in Drosophila. Most recent work now shows that spermidine operates directly at synapses, allowing for an autophagy-dependent homeostatic regulation of presynaptic specializations. How exactly autophagic regulations intersect with synaptic plasticity should be an interesting subject for future research.},

	Abstract = {The aging process drives the progressive deterioration of an organism and is thus subject to a complex interplay of regulatory and executing mechanisms. Our understanding of this process eventually aims at the delay and/or prevention of age-related pathologies, among them the age-dependent decrease in cognitive performance (e.g., learning and memory). Using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which combines a generally high mechanistic conservation with an efficient experimental access regarding aging and memory studies, we have recently unveiled a protective function of polyamines (including spermidine) against age-induced memory impairment (AMI). The flies' age-dependent decline of aversive olfactory memory, an established model for AMI, can be rescued by both pharmacological treatment with spermidine and genetic modulation that increases endogenous polyamine levels. Notably, we find that this effect strictly depends on autophagy, which is remarkable in light of the fact that autophagy is considered a key regulator of aging in other contexts. Given that polyamines in general and spermidine in particular are endogenous metabolites, our findings place them as candidate target substances for AMI treatment.},

	Abstract = {Although autophagy has widely been conceived as a self-destructive mechanism that causes cell death, accumulating evidence suggests that autophagy usually mediates cytoprotection, thereby avoiding the apoptotic or necrotic demise of stressed cells. Recent evidence produced by our groups demonstrates that autophagy is also involved in pharmacological manipulations that increase longevity. Exogenous supply of the polyamine spermidine can prolong the lifespan of (while inducing autophagy in) yeast, nematodes and flies. Similarly, resveratrol can trigger autophagy in cells from different organisms, extend lifespan in nematodes, and ameliorate the fitness of human cells undergoing metabolic stress. These beneficial effects are lost when essential autophagy modulators are genetically or pharmacologically inactivated, indicating that autophagy is required for the cytoprotective and/or anti-aging effects of spermidine and resveratrol. Genetic and functional studies indicate that spermidine inhibits histone acetylases, while resveratrol activates the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 to confer cytoprotection/longevity. Although it remains elusive whether the same histones (or perhaps other nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins) act as the downstream targets of spermidine and resveratrol, these results point to an essential role of protein hypoacetylation in autophagy control and in the regulation of longevity.},

The efficacy of forming new memories declines with advancing age, but the synaptic changes underlying age-induced memory impairment remain poorly under- stood. Recently, we found spermidine feeding to specifically suppress age-dependent impairments in forming olfactory memories, providing a mean to search for synaptic changes involved in age-dependent memory impairment. Here, we show that a specific synaptic compartment, the presynaptic active zone (AZ), increases the size of its ultrastruc- tural elaboration and releases significantly more synaptic vesicles with advancing age. These age-induced AZ changes, however, were fully suppressed by spermidine feeding. A genetically enforced enlargement of AZ scaffolds (four gene-copies of BRP) impaired mem- ory formation in young animals. Thus, in the Drosophila nervous system, aging AZs seem to steer towards the upper limit of their operational range, limiting synaptic plasticity and contributing to impairment of memory formation. Spermidine feeding suppresses age- dependent memory impairment by counteracting these age-dependent changes directly at the synapse.},

	Abstract = {Life span is regulated by genetic mechanisms as well as environmental or physiological factors. Neurons detect sensory cues from the environment and internal signals generated within the animal, and drive physiological, metabolic and behavioral changes that optimize fitness and survival of the organism. Recent studies, mainly based on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, suggest that the nervous system is instructive for aging and life span control. Chemosensation and thermosensation, as well as perception of other environmental cues, act upon specific neuronal types and influence life span via distinct secreted neuronal signals. In addition to sensory cues in the environment, neurons also respond to a wide range of external and internal stressors, and coordinate organismal-wide stress responses across different tissues. Life span extension is found in C. elegans strains whose systemic stress response is increased by genetic perturbation of mitochondrial respiration in the neurons, as well as in strains that overexpress the ER stress transcription factor XBP-1 in the nervous system. These observations support a model where the nervous system acts as a platform for life span control by integrating information from the environment and signals that report on the physiological states of the animal.},

Animal studies indicate that exercise may be disease modifying through several mechanisms including reduction of AD pathology. We carried out a systematic review of intervention studies of physical exercise with hippocampal volume (on MRI), amyloid-$\beta$, total tau, phosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 18F-FDG-PET or amyloid PET as outcome measures in healthy subjects, patients with subjective memory complaints, mild cognitive impairment, or AD. We identified a total of 8 studies of which 6 investigated the effects of exercise on hippocampal volume in healthy subjects and 1 on CSF biomarkers and 1 on hippocampal volume in AD, and none investigating the remaining outcome measures or patient groups. Methodological quality of identified studies was generally low. One study found a detrimental effect on hippocampal volume and one found a positive effect, whereas the remaining studies did not find an effect of exercise on outcome measures. The present systematic study identified a relatively small number of studies, which did not support an effect of exercise on hippocampal volume. Methodological issues such small to moderate sample sizes and inadequate ramdomization procedures further limits conclusions. Our findings highlight the difficulties in conducting high quality studies of exercise and further studies are needed before definite conclusions may be reached.},

	Abstract = {Introduction Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration, evidence of which may be detected in vivo via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling. Physical activity (PA) has emerged as a possible modifier of these AD-related pathological changes. Consequently, the aim of this study was to cross-sectionally examine the relationship between objectively measured PA and CSF levels of A$\beta$42 and tau in asymptomatic late-middle-aged adults at risk for AD. Methods Eighty-five cognitively healthy late-middle-aged adults (age = 64.31 years, 61.2{\%} female) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention participated in this study. They wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+) for one week to record free-living PA, yielding measures of sedentariness and various intensities of PA (i.e., light, moderate, and vigorous). They also underwent lumbar puncture to collect CSF, from which A$\beta$42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau were immunoassayed. Regression analyses were used to examine the association between accelerometer measures and CSF biomarkers, adjusting for age, sex, and other relevant covariates. Results Engagement in moderate PA was associated with higher A$\beta$42 (P = .008), lower total tau/A$\beta$42 (P = .006), and lower phosphorylated tau/A$\beta$42 (P = .030). In contrast, neither light nor vigorous PA was associated with any of the biomarkers. Increased sedentariness was associated with reduced A$\beta$42 (P = .014).

	Abstract = {Insight into how amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) aggregation occurs in vivo is vital for understanding the molecular pathways that underlie Alzheimer's disease and requires new techniques that provide detailed kinetic and mechanistic information. Using noninvasive fluorescence lifetime recordings, we imaged the formation of A$\beta$(1-40) and A$\beta$(1-42) aggregates in live cells. For both peptides, the cellular uptake via endocytosis is rapid and spontaneous. They are then retained in lysosomes, where their accumulation leads to aggregation. The kinetics of A$\beta$(1-42) aggregation are considerably faster than those of A$\beta$(1-40) and, unlike those of the latter peptide, show no detectable lag phase. We used superresolution fluorescence imaging to examine the resulting aggregates and could observe compact amyloid structures, likely because of spatial confinement within cellular compartments. Taken together, these findings provide clues as to how A$\beta$ aggregation may occur within neurons. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

	Abstract = {Misfolding and aggregation of peptides and proteins is a characteristic of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD the $\beta$-amyloid peptide (A$\beta$) aggregates to form characteristic fibrillar structures, which are the deposits found as plaques in the brains of patients. We have used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, dSTORM, to probe the process of in situ A$\beta$ aggregation and the morphology of the ensuing aggregates with a resolution better than 20 nm. We are able to distinguish different types of structures, including oligomeric assemblies and mature fibrils, and observe a number of morphological differences between the species formed in vitro and in vivo, which may be significant in the context of disease. Our data support the recent view that intracellular A$\beta$ could be associated with A$\beta$ pathogenicity in AD, although the major deposits are extracellular, and suggest that this approach will be widely applicable to studies of the molecular mechanisms of protein deposition diseases.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Aggregation of $\alpha$-synuclein has been linked to both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. Recent studies suggest that $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates may spread from cell to cell and raise questions about the propagation of neurodegeneration. While continuous progress has been made characterizing $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates in vitro, there is a lack of information regarding the structure of these species inside the cells. Here, we use confocal fluorescence microscopy in combination with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, dSTORM, to investigate $\alpha$-synuclein uptake when added exogenously to SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and to probe in situ morphological features of $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates with near nanometer resolution. We demonstrate that using dSTORM, it is possible to follow noninvasively the uptake of extracellularly added $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates by the cells. Once the aggregates are internalized, they move through the endosomal pathway and accumulate in lysosomes to be degraded. Our dSTORM data show that $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates remain assembled after internalization and they are shortened as they move through the endosomal pathway. No further aggregation was observed inside the lysosomes as speculated in the literature, nor in the cytoplasm of the cells. Our study thus highlights the superresolution capability of dSTORM to follow directly the endocytotic uptake of extracellularly added amyloid aggregates and to probe the morphology of in situ protein aggregates even when they accumulate in small vesicular compartments.},

Over the past decade, data have emerged from the use of synthetic A beta peptides, cell culture models, beta-amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice and human brain to suggest that pre-fibrillar, diffusible assemblies of A beta are also deleterious. Although the precise molecular identity of these soluble toxins remains unsettled, accumulating evidence suggests that soluble forms of A beta are indeed the proximate effectors of synapse loss and neuronal injury.

	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Here, we investigated the preventive effect of a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, cilostazol against cognitive decline in AD mouse model. In vitro studies using N2a cells stably expressing human amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutation (N2aSwe) showed that cilostazol decreased the amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) levels in the conditioned medium and cell lysates. Cilostazol attenuated the expression of ApoE, which is responsible for A$\beta$ aggregation, in N2aSwe. Intracerebroventricular injection of A$\beta$25-35 in C57BL/6J mice resulted in increased immunoreactivity of A$\beta$ and p-Tau, and microglia activation in the brain. Oral administration of cilostazol for 2weeks before A$\beta$ administration and once a day for 4weeks post-surgery almost completely prevented the A$\beta$-induced increases of A$\beta$ and p-Tau immunoreactivity, as well as CD11b immunoreactivity. However, post-treatment with cilostazol 4weeks after A$\beta$ administration, when A$\beta$ was already accumulated, did not prevent the A$\beta$-induced neuropathological responses. Furthermore, cilostazol did not affect the neprilysin and insulin degrading enzymes involved in the degradation of the A$\beta$ peptide, but decreased ApoE levels in A$\beta$-injected brain. In addition, cilostazol significantly improved spatial learning and memory in A$\beta$-injected mice. The findings suggest that a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, cilostazol significantly decreased A$\beta$ accumulation and improved memory impairment induced by A$\beta$25-35. The beneficial effects of cilostazol might be explained by the reduction of A$\beta$ accumulation and tau phosphorylation, not through an increase in A$\beta$ degradation but via a significant decrease in ApoE-mediated A$\beta$ aggregation. Cilostazol may be the basis of a novel strategy for the therapy of AD. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Autophagy was first discovered by transmission electron microscopy more than 50 years ago. For decades, electron microscopy was the only way to reliably detect autophagic compartments in cells because no specific protein markers were known. In the 1970s, however, the introduction of biochemical methods enabled quantitative studies of autophagic-lysosomal degradation, and in the 1980s specific biochemical assays for autophagic sequestration became available. Since the identification of autophagy-related genes in the 1990s, combined fluorescence microscopy, biochemical and genetic methods have taken the leading role in autophagy research. However, electron microscopy is still needed to confirm and verify results obtained by other methods, and also to produce novel knowledge that would not be achievable by any other experimental approach. Confocal microscopy, with its ever-improving resolution, is probably the best-suited morphological approach to investigate the dynamic aspects of autophagy. However, for analyzing the ultrastructural details of the many novel organelles and mechanisms involved in specific subtypes of autophagy, the electron microscope is still indispensable. This review will summarize the impact that electron microscopy has had on autophagy research sinc e the discovery of this self-degradation process in the mid-1950s. Astonishingly, some of the "novel" concepts and principles of autophagy, presented in the recent studies, were already proposed several decades ago by the pioneering, accurate and passionate work of virtuoso electron microscopists. {\textcopyright} 2011 Landes Bioscience.},

The relationship between such preexisting labelled lysosomes, and forming and early cytosegresomes (autophagic vacuoles, cytolysosomes), was studied in cells subjected to autophagy-inducing treatments (i.p. injected bacitracin for renal tubule cells; partial hepatectomy and i.p. injected glucagon for hepatocytes). Newly formed cytosegresomes containing unaltered organelles were spatially unrelated to preexisting labelled lysosomes and appeared to represent "pre-lysosomes" of the autophagosome type lacking lysosomal enzyme. Later, the apparent autophagosomes seemed to fuse with preexisting labelled lysosomes. The findings are compatible with autophagosome-lysosome fusion as the mechanism whereby lysosomal enzymes are brought in contact with sequestered cytoplasmic organelles for subsequent digestion. {\textcopyright} 1969.},

	Abstract = {In animals, cells are dependent on extracellular signals to prevent apoptosis. However, using growth factor-dependent cells from Bax/Bak-deficient mice, we demonstrate that apoptosis is not essential to limit cell autonomous survival. Following growth factor withdrawal, Bax -/- Bak -/- cells activate autophagy, undergo progressive atrophy, and ultimately succumb to death. These effects result from loss of the ability to take up sufficient nutrients to maintain cellular bioenergetics. Despite abundant extracellular nutrients, growth factor-deprived cells maintain ATP production from catabolism of intracellular substrates through autophagy. Autophagy is essential for maintaining cell survival following growth factor withdrawal and can sustain viability for several weeks. During this time, cells respond to growth factor readdition by rapid restoration of the ability to take up and metabolize glucose and by subsequent recovery of their original size and proliferative potential. Thus, growth factor signal transduction is required to direct the utilization of sufficient exogenous nutrients to maintain cell viability.},

Apart from the direct influence of serum components on cultured cells, the reaction of serum components with tested drugs cannot be ignored, which usually results in the false conclusion on the activity of the tested drugs. Here we report the toxicity effect of polyamines (spermidine and spermine) on cultured cells, especially on drug-resistant cancer cell lines, which resulted from the oxidative degradation of polyamines by amine oxidases in serum supplement. Upon adding spermidine or spermine, high concentration of H2O2, an enzyme oxidation product of polyamines, was generated in culture media containing ruminant serum, such as fetal bovine serum (FBS), calf serum, bovine serum, goat serum or horse serum, but not in the media containing human serum. Drug-resistant cancer cell lines showed much higher sensitivity to the oxidation products of polyamines (H2O2 and acrolein) than their wild cell lines, which was due to their low antioxidative capacity.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism of the antiproliferation effect of spermidine and spermine was studied using a cell culture system of mouse FM3A cells. The addition of either 10 mM spermidine or 2 mM spermine to the growth medium containing 0.9 mM Mg2+ greatly inhibited cell growth (more than 90{\%}). A decrease in the Mg2+ concentration to 50 $\mu$M in the growth medium, but without the polyamine addition, did not influence cell growth. However, the concentrations of spermidine and spermine necessary for the inhibition of cell growth when cells were cultured in the presence of 50 $\mu$M Mg2+ were much smaller (2 mM spermidine and 0.15 mM spermine). Nevertheless, the amount of polyamines accumulating in cells which could cause the inhibition of cell growth was almost the same, regardless of the large difference in the added polyamine concentrations. At the early stage of polyamine accumulation, the inhibition of cell growth correlated with the decrease of Mg2+ content, but not with a decrease of the ATP content. The decrease in Mg2+ content correlated well with the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis, especially protein synthesis. Thus, the inhibition of cell growth at the early stage of polyamine accumulation was thought to be due to the inactivation of ribosomes through the replacement of Mg2+ on magnesium‐binding sites by polyamines. The decrease in Mg2+ content was mainly caused by the inhibition of Mg2+ transport by polyamines. At the later stage of polyamine accumulation, a decrease in ATP content was also observed. This was followed by swelling of the mitochondria, which may be a symptom of the subsequent cell death. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

	Abstract = {The D-R cell subline, an ornithine decarboxylase-overproducing variant of L1210 mouse leukemia cells, shows a growth advantage at low osmolality due to its high putrescine content. We tested the ability of spermidine to fulfill the role of putrescine under hyposmotic conditions. Although spermidine (1- 30 $\mu$M) had no effect on growth under normosmotic conditions (325 mosm/kg), it was strongly inhibitory to D-R cell proliferation at 150 mosm/kg in a concentration-dependent manner. Hypotonic shock greatly increased the rate of spermidine uptake in D-R cells. The increased spermidine content enhanced total putrescine synthesis through a large induction of cytosolic spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase activity but also promoted the excretion of most of the putrescine synthesized by the cells. Delaying the addition of spermidine until 24 h after hypotonic shock resulted in a much sharper decrease in D-R cell viability and strongly depressed polyamine contents. These lethal effects occurred between 8 and 24 h after spermidine addition and followed a dramatic increase in the rate and extent of spermidine accumulation which overrode the metabolic capacity of the N1- acetyltransferase/polyamine oxidase (PAO) pathway. Inhibition of PAO partly reversed the effect of spermidine on growth when the polyamine was added at the time of hypotonic shock, but not 24 h later. Similar experiments performed with $\alpha$-methylspermidine, a metabolically resistant analog, which can completely fulfill cellular requirements for spermidine in normosmotic media, suggested that the lethal effect of a delayed spermidine addition is caused predominantly by excessive accumulation with a minor contribution resulting from stress due to polyamine oxidase activity. In contrast, in hypotonically shocked L1210 cells, spermidine stimulated cell proliferation (albeit less effectively than putrescine), there was no lethal effect of a delayed addition of $\alpha$-methylspermidine, and there was no time-dependent increase in the rate of $\alpha$-methylspermidine uptake. Thus, the spermidine transport system is strongly enhanced by hyposmotic shock in D-R cells, which can result in extensive cell death from overaccumulation of the polyamine and, to a lesser extent, from stress related to the PAO-catalyzed degradation of N1-acetylspermidine. The absence of these effects in parental L1210 cells indicates that the acquisition of an ornithine decarboxylase-overproducing phenotype also involves major modifications in the expression and/or regulation of polyamine transport.},

	Abstract = {Autophagy is a vital pathway for the removal of $\beta$-amyloid peptide (A$\beta$) and the aggregated proteins that cause Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously found that cilostazol induced SIRT1 expression and its activity in neuronal cells, and thus, we hypothesized that cilostazol might stimulate clearances of A$\beta$ and C-terminal APP fragment $\beta$ subunit (APP-CTF$\beta$) by up-regulating autophagy.When N2a cells were exposed to soluble A$\beta$1-42, protein levels of beclin-1, autophagy-related protein5 (Atg5), and SIRT1 decreased significantly. Pretreatment with cilostazol (10-30 $\mu$M) or resveratrol (20 $\mu$M) prevented these A$\beta$1-42 evoked suppressions. LC3-II (a marker of mammalian autophagy) levels were significantly increased by cilostazol, and this increase was reduced by 3-methyladenine. To evoke endogenous A$\beta$ overproduction, N2aSwe cells (N2a cells stably expressing human APP containing the Swedish mutation) were cultured in medium with or without tetracycline (Tet+ for 48 h and then placed in Tet-condition). A$\beta$ and APP-CTF$\beta$ expressions were increased after 12∼24 h in Tet-condition, and these increased expressions were significantly reduced by pretreating cilostazol. Cilostazol-induced reductions in the expressions of A$\beta$ and APP-CTF$\beta$ were blocked by bafilomycin A1 (a blocker of autophagosome to lysosome fusion). After knockdown of the SIRT1 gene (to ∼40{\%} in SIRT1 protein), cilostazol failed to elevate the expressions of beclin-1, Atg5, and LC3-II, indicating that cilostazol increases these expressions by up-regulating SIRT1. Further, decreased cell viability induced by A$\beta$ was prevented by cilostazol, and this inhibition was reversed by 3-methyladenine, indicating that the protective effect of cilostazol against A$\beta$ induced neurotoxicity is, in part, ascribable to the induction of autophagy. In conclusion, cilostazol modulates autophagy by increasing the activation of SIRT1, and thereby enhances A$\beta$ clearance and increases cell viability. Copyright:},

	Abstract = {A key event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is the conversion of the peptide beta-amyloid (A??) from its soluble monomeric form into various aggregated morphologies in the brain. Preventing aggregation of A?? is being actively pursued as a primary therapeutic strategy for treating AD. Trehalose, a simple disaccharide, has been shown to be effective in preventing the deactivation of numerous proteins and in protecting cells against stress. Here, we show that trehalose is also effective in inhibiting aggregation of A?? and reducing its cytotoxicity, although it shows differential effects toward A??40 and A??42. When co-incubated with A??40, trehalose inhibits formation of both fibrillar and oligomeric morphologies as determined by fluorescence staining and atomic force microscopy (AFM). However, when co-incubated with A??42, trehalose inhibits formation only of the fibrillar morphology, with significant oligomeric formation still present. When aggregated mixtures were incubated with SH-SY5Y cells, trehalose was shown to reduce the toxicity of A??40 mixtures, but not A??42. These results provide additional evidence that aggregation of A?? into soluble oligomeric forms is a pathological step in AD and that A??42 in particular is more susceptible to forming these toxic oligomers than A??40. These results also suggest that the use of trehalose, a highly soluble, low-priced sugar, as part of a potential therapeutic cocktail to control A?? peptide aggregation and toxicity warrants further study. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Modulating the tau level may represent a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD), as accumulating evidence shows that Abeta-induced neurodegeneration is mediated by tau. It is therefore important to understand the expression and degradation of tau in neurons. Recently we showed that overexpressed mutant tau and tau aggregates are degraded via the autophagic pathway in an N2a cell model. Here we investigated whether autophagy is involved in the degradation of endogenous tau in cultured primary neurons. We activated this pathway in primary neurons with trehalose, an enhancer of autophagy. This resulted in the reduction of endogenous tau protein. Tau phosphorylation at several sites elevated in AD pathology had little influence on its degradation by autophagy. Furthermore, by using a neuronal cell model of tauopathy, we showed that activation of autophagy suppresses tau aggregation and eliminates cytotoxicity. Notably, apart from activating autophagy, trehalose also inhibits tau aggregation directly.

	Abstract = {Background: This study was proposed to compare the efficacy and safety of GTM-1, Rapamycin (Rap), and Carbamazepine (CBZ) in managing Alzheimer disease (AD). The impact of the above mentioned therapeutic drugs on autophagy was also investigated in our study. Material/Methods: Firstly, 3×Tg AD mice were randomly allocated into 4 groups (each group with 10 mice), in which AD mice were separately treated with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, vehicle group), GTM-1 (6 mg/kg), Rap (1 mg/kg), and CBZ (100 mg/kg). Then spatial memory and learning ability of mice was tested using the Morris water maze. Routine blood tests were performed to evaluate the toxicity of these drugs. Amyloid-$\beta$42 (A$\beta$42) concentration was detected by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Proteins related to autophagy were detected by Western blot. Results: GTM-1, Rap, and CBZ significantly improved the spatial memory of 3×Tg AD mice compared to that in the vehicle group (all P {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, this study revealed that CBZ dosage was related to toxicity in mice. All of the above drugs significantly increased the expression of LC3-II and reduced A$\beta$42 levels in hippocampi of 3×Tg AD mice (all P {\textless} 0.05). On the other hand, neither GTM-1 nor CBZ had significant influence on the expression of proteins on the mTOR pathway. Conclusions: GTM-1 can alleviate the AD syndrome by activating autophagy in a manner that is dependent on the mTOR pathway and it therefore can be considered as an alternative to Rap.},

	Abstract = {Neurons are highly specialized postmitotic cells that depend on dynamic cellular processes for their proper function. These include among others, neuronal growth and maturation, axonal migration, synapse formation and elimination, all requiring continuous protein synthesis and degradation. Therefore quality-control processes in neurons are directly linked to their physiology. Autophagy is a tightly regulated cellular degradation pathway by which defective or superfluouscytosolic proteins, organelles and other cellular constituents are sequestered in autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Here we present emerging evidence indicating that constitutive autophagic fluxin neurons has essential roles in key neuronal processes under physiological conditions. Moreover, we discuss how perturbations of the autophagic pathway may underlie diverse pathological phenotypes in neurons associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.},

@article{Kawaoka2017,
	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. When macroautophagy (autophagy) is induced by nutrient starvation or rapamycin treatment, Atg (autophagy-related) proteins are assembled at a restricted region close to the vacuole. Subsequently, the phagophore expands to form a closed autophagosome. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells overexpressing precursor Ape1 (prApe1), a specific autophagosome cargo protein, the phagophore can be visualized as a cup-shaped structure labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Atg8. Previously, our group has shown that the maximum length of GFP-Atg8-labeled structures reflects the magnitude of bulk autophagy. In that study, the morphological parameters of the autophagy-related structures were extracted manually, requiring a great deal of time. Moreover, only well-expanded phagophores were subjected to further analysis. Here we report Qautas (Quantitative autophagy-related structure analysis system), a high-throughput and comprehensive system for morphological analysis of autophagy-related structures using a combination of image processing and machine learning. We describe both the manual method and Qautas in detail.},

@article{Park2016,
	Abstract = {A neuroprotective role of autophagymediates the degradation of $\beta$-amyloid peptide (A$\beta$)in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The previous study showed cilostazolmodulates autophagy by increasing beclin1, Atg5 and LC3-II expressions, and depletes intracellular A$\beta$ accumulation. This study elucidated themechanisms through which cilostazolmodulates the autophagic degradation ofA$\beta$ in neurons. InN2a cells, cilostazol (10--30 $\mu$M), significantly increased the expression of P-AMPK$\alpha$ (Thr 172) and downstreamP-ACC(acetyl-CoA carboxylase) (Ser 79) as did resveratrol (SIRT1 activator), or AICAR(AMPK activator),whichwere blocked by KT5720, compoundC(AMPK inhibitor), or sirtinol. Furthermore, phosphorylated-mTOR(Ser 2448) and phosphorylated-P70S6K(Thr 389) expressionswere suppressed, and LC3-II levels were elevated in associationwith decreased P62/Sqstm1by cilostazol.Cilostazol increased cathepsinB activity and decreased p62/SQSTM1, consequently decreased accumulation of A$\beta$1--42 in the activatedN2aSwe cells, and these resultswere blocked by sirtinol, compound Cand bafilomycinA1 (autophagosome blocker), suggesting enhanced autophagosome for- mation by cilostazol. In SIRT1 gene-silencedN2a cells, cilostazol failed to increase the expressions of P-LKB1 (Ser 428) andP-AMPK$\alpha$,which contrastedwith its effect in negative control cells transfectedwith scrambled siRNA duplex. Further,N2a cells transfectedwith expression vectors encoding pcDNA SIRT1 showed increased P-AMPK$\alpha$ expression,which mimicked the effect of cilostazol inN2a cells; suggesting cilostazol-stimulated expressions of P-LKB1 and P-AMPK$\alpha$were SIRT1-dependent.Unlike their effects inN2a cells, inHeLa cells, which lack LKB1, cilostazol and resveratrol did not elevate SIRT1 orP-AMPK$\alpha$ expression, indicating cilostazol and resveratrol-stimulated expressions of SIRT1 and P-AMPK$\alpha$ are LKB1-dependent. In conclusion, cilostazol upregulates autophagy by activating SIRT1-cou- pledP-LKB1/P-AMPK$\alpha$ and inhibitingmTORactivation, thereby decreasing A$\beta$ accumulation.},
