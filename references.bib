	Abstract = {Insight into how amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) aggregation occurs in vivo is vital for understanding the molecular pathways that underlie Alzheimer's disease and requires new techniques that provide detailed kinetic and mechanistic information. Using noninvasive fluorescence lifetime recordings, we imaged the formation of A$\beta$(1-40) and A$\beta$(1-42) aggregates in live cells. For both peptides, the cellular uptake via endocytosis is rapid and spontaneous. They are then retained in lysosomes, where their accumulation leads to aggregation. The kinetics of A$\beta$(1-42) aggregation are considerably faster than those of A$\beta$(1-40) and, unlike those of the latter peptide, show no detectable lag phase. We used superresolution fluorescence imaging to examine the resulting aggregates and could observe compact amyloid structures, likely because of spatial confinement within cellular compartments. Taken together, these findings provide clues as to how A$\beta$ aggregation may occur within neurons. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

	Abstract = {Misfolding and aggregation of peptides and proteins is a characteristic of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD the $\beta$-amyloid peptide (A$\beta$) aggregates to form characteristic fibrillar structures, which are the deposits found as plaques in the brains of patients. We have used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, dSTORM, to probe the process of in situ A$\beta$ aggregation and the morphology of the ensuing aggregates with a resolution better than 20 nm. We are able to distinguish different types of structures, including oligomeric assemblies and mature fibrils, and observe a number of morphological differences between the species formed in vitro and in vivo, which may be significant in the context of disease. Our data support the recent view that intracellular A$\beta$ could be associated with A$\beta$ pathogenicity in AD, although the major deposits are extracellular, and suggest that this approach will be widely applicable to studies of the molecular mechanisms of protein deposition diseases.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Aggregation of $\alpha$-synuclein has been linked to both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. Recent studies suggest that $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates may spread from cell to cell and raise questions about the propagation of neurodegeneration. While continuous progress has been made characterizing $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates in vitro, there is a lack of information regarding the structure of these species inside the cells. Here, we use confocal fluorescence microscopy in combination with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, dSTORM, to investigate $\alpha$-synuclein uptake when added exogenously to SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and to probe in situ morphological features of $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates with near nanometer resolution. We demonstrate that using dSTORM, it is possible to follow noninvasively the uptake of extracellularly added $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates by the cells. Once the aggregates are internalized, they move through the endosomal pathway and accumulate in lysosomes to be degraded. Our dSTORM data show that $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates remain assembled after internalization and they are shortened as they move through the endosomal pathway. No further aggregation was observed inside the lysosomes as speculated in the literature, nor in the cytoplasm of the cells. Our study thus highlights the superresolution capability of dSTORM to follow directly the endocytotic uptake of extracellularly added amyloid aggregates and to probe the morphology of in situ protein aggregates even when they accumulate in small vesicular compartments.},

	Abstract = {Converging lines of evidence suggest that progressive accumulation of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) plays a central role in the genesis of Alzheimer's disease, but it was long assumed that A beta had to be assembled into extracellular amyloid fibrils to exert its cytotoxic effects. Over the past decade, data have emerged from the use of synthetic A beta peptides, cell culture models, beta-amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice and human brain to suggest that pre-fibrillar, diffusible assemblies of A beta are also deleterious. Although the precise molecular identity of these soluble toxins remains unsettled, accumulating evidence suggests that soluble forms of A beta are indeed the proximate effectors of synapse loss and neuronal injury. Here we review recent progress in understanding the role of soluble oligomers in Alzheimer's disease.},

@article{Park2011,
	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Here, we investigated the preventive effect of a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, cilostazol against cognitive decline in AD mouse model. In vitro studies using N2a cells stably expressing human amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutation (N2aSwe) showed that cilostazol decreased the amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) levels in the conditioned medium and cell lysates. Cilostazol attenuated the expression of ApoE, which is responsible for A$\beta$ aggregation, in N2aSwe. Intracerebroventricular injection of A$\beta$25-35 in C57BL/6J mice resulted in increased immunoreactivity of A$\beta$ and p-Tau, and microglia activation in the brain. Oral administration of cilostazol for 2weeks before A$\beta$ administration and once a day for 4weeks post-surgery almost completely prevented the A$\beta$-induced increases of A$\beta$ and p-Tau immunoreactivity, as well as CD11b immunoreactivity. However, post-treatment with cilostazol 4weeks after A$\beta$ administration, when A$\beta$ was already accumulated, did not prevent the A$\beta$-induced neuropathological responses. Furthermore, cilostazol did not affect the neprilysin and insulin degrading enzymes involved in the degradation of the A$\beta$ peptide, but decreased ApoE levels in A$\beta$-injected brain. In addition, cilostazol significantly improved spatial learning and memory in A$\beta$-injected mice. The findings suggest that a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, cilostazol significantly decreased A$\beta$ accumulation and improved memory impairment induced by A$\beta$25-35. The beneficial effects of cilostazol might be explained by the reduction of A$\beta$ accumulation and tau phosphorylation, not through an increase in A$\beta$ degradation but via a significant decrease in ApoE-mediated A$\beta$ aggregation. Cilostazol may be the basis of a novel strategy for the therapy of AD. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Eskelinen2011,
	Abstract = {Autophagy was first discovered by transmission electron microscopy more than 50 years ago. For decades, electron microscopy was the only way to reliably detect autophagic compartments in cells because no specific protein markers were known. In the 1970s, however, the introduction of biochemical methods enabled quantitative studies of autophagic-lysosomal degradation, and in the 1980s specific biochemical assays for autophagic sequestration became available. Since the identification of autophagy-related genes in the 1990s, combined fluorescence microscopy, biochemical and genetic methods have taken the leading role in autophagy research. However, electron microscopy is still needed to confirm and verify results obtained by other methods, and also to produce novel knowledge that would not be achievable by any other experimental approach. Confocal microscopy, with its ever-improving resolution, is probably the best-suited morphological approach to investigate the dynamic aspects of autophagy. However, for analyzing the ultrastructural details of the many novel organelles and mechanisms involved in specific subtypes of autophagy, the electron microscope is still indispensable. This review will summarize the impact that electron microscopy has had on autophagy research sinc e the discovery of this self-degradation process in the mid-1950s. Astonishingly, some of the "novel" concepts and principles of autophagy, presented in the recent studies, were already proposed several decades ago by the pioneering, accurate and passionate work of virtuoso electron microscopists. {\textcopyright} 2011 Landes Bioscience.},

Newly formed cytosegresomes containing unaltered organelles were spatially unrelated to preexisting labelled lysosomes and appeared to represent "pre-lysosomes" of the autophagosome type lacking lysosomal enzyme. Later, the apparent autophagosomes seemed to fuse with preexisting labelled lysosomes.

	Abstract = {In animals, cells are dependent on extracellular signals to prevent apoptosis. However, using growth factor-dependent cells from Bax/Bak-deficient mice, we demonstrate that apoptosis is not essential to limit cell autonomous survival. Following growth factor withdrawal, Bax -/- Bak -/- cells activate autophagy, undergo progressive atrophy, and ultimately succumb to death. These effects result from loss of the ability to take up sufficient nutrients to maintain cellular bioenergetics. Despite abundant extracellular nutrients, growth factor-deprived cells maintain ATP production from catabolism of intracellular substrates through autophagy. Autophagy is essential for maintaining cell survival following growth factor withdrawal and can sustain viability for several weeks. During this time, cells respond to growth factor readdition by rapid restoration of the ability to take up and metabolize glucose and by subsequent recovery of their original size and proliferative potential. Thus, growth factor signal transduction is required to direct the utilization of sufficient exogenous nutrients to maintain cell viability.},

Apart from the direct influence of serum components on cultured cells, the reaction of serum components with tested drugs cannot be ignored, which usually results in the false conclusion on the activity of the tested drugs. Here we report the toxicity effect of polyamines (spermidine and spermine) on cultured cells, especially on drug-resistant cancer cell lines, which resulted from the oxidative degradation of polyamines by amine oxidases in serum supplement. Upon adding spermidine or spermine, high concentration of H2O2, an enzyme oxidation product of polyamines, was generated in culture media containing ruminant serum, such as fetal bovine serum (FBS), calf serum, bovine serum, goat serum or horse serum, but not in the media containing human serum. Drug-resistant cancer cell lines showed much higher sensitivity to the oxidation products of polyamines (H2O2 and acrolein) than their wild cell lines, which was due to their low antioxidative capacity.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism of the antiproliferation effect of spermidine and spermine was studied using a cell culture system of mouse FM3A cells. The addition of either 10 mM spermidine or 2 mM spermine to the growth medium containing 0.9 mM Mg2+ greatly inhibited cell growth (more than 90{\%}). A decrease in the Mg2+ concentration to 50 $\mu$M in the growth medium, but without the polyamine addition, did not influence cell growth. However, the concentrations of spermidine and spermine necessary for the inhibition of cell growth when cells were cultured in the presence of 50 $\mu$M Mg2+ were much smaller (2 mM spermidine and 0.15 mM spermine). Nevertheless, the amount of polyamines accumulating in cells which could cause the inhibition of cell growth was almost the same, regardless of the large difference in the added polyamine concentrations. At the early stage of polyamine accumulation, the inhibition of cell growth correlated with the decrease of Mg2+ content, but not with a decrease of the ATP content. The decrease in Mg2+ content correlated well with the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis, especially protein synthesis. Thus, the inhibition of cell growth at the early stage of polyamine accumulation was thought to be due to the inactivation of ribosomes through the replacement of Mg2+ on magnesium‐binding sites by polyamines. The decrease in Mg2+ content was mainly caused by the inhibition of Mg2+ transport by polyamines. At the later stage of polyamine accumulation, a decrease in ATP content was also observed. This was followed by swelling of the mitochondria, which may be a symptom of the subsequent cell death. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

	Abstract = {The D-R cell subline, an ornithine decarboxylase-overproducing variant of L1210 mouse leukemia cells, shows a growth advantage at low osmolality due to its high putrescine content. We tested the ability of spermidine to fulfill the role of putrescine under hyposmotic conditions. Although spermidine (1- 30 $\mu$M) had no effect on growth under normosmotic conditions (325 mosm/kg), it was strongly inhibitory to D-R cell proliferation at 150 mosm/kg in a concentration-dependent manner. Hypotonic shock greatly increased the rate of spermidine uptake in D-R cells. The increased spermidine content enhanced total putrescine synthesis through a large induction of cytosolic spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase activity but also promoted the excretion of most of the putrescine synthesized by the cells. Delaying the addition of spermidine until 24 h after hypotonic shock resulted in a much sharper decrease in D-R cell viability and strongly depressed polyamine contents. These lethal effects occurred between 8 and 24 h after spermidine addition and followed a dramatic increase in the rate and extent of spermidine accumulation which overrode the metabolic capacity of the N1- acetyltransferase/polyamine oxidase (PAO) pathway. Inhibition of PAO partly reversed the effect of spermidine on growth when the polyamine was added at the time of hypotonic shock, but not 24 h later. Similar experiments performed with $\alpha$-methylspermidine, a metabolically resistant analog, which can completely fulfill cellular requirements for spermidine in normosmotic media, suggested that the lethal effect of a delayed spermidine addition is caused predominantly by excessive accumulation with a minor contribution resulting from stress due to polyamine oxidase activity. In contrast, in hypotonically shocked L1210 cells, spermidine stimulated cell proliferation (albeit less effectively than putrescine), there was no lethal effect of a delayed addition of $\alpha$-methylspermidine, and there was no time-dependent increase in the rate of $\alpha$-methylspermidine uptake. Thus, the spermidine transport system is strongly enhanced by hyposmotic shock in D-R cells, which can result in extensive cell death from overaccumulation of the polyamine and, to a lesser extent, from stress related to the PAO-catalyzed degradation of N1-acetylspermidine. The absence of these effects in parental L1210 cells indicates that the acquisition of an ornithine decarboxylase-overproducing phenotype also involves major modifications in the expression and/or regulation of polyamine transport.},

	Abstract = {Autophagy is a vital pathway for the removal of $\beta$-amyloid peptide (A$\beta$) and the aggregated proteins that cause Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously found that cilostazol induced SIRT1 expression and its activity in neuronal cells, and thus, we hypothesized that cilostazol might stimulate clearances of A$\beta$ and C-terminal APP fragment $\beta$ subunit (APP-CTF$\beta$) by up-regulating autophagy.When N2a cells were exposed to soluble A$\beta$1-42, protein levels of beclin-1, autophagy-related protein5 (Atg5), and SIRT1 decreased significantly. Pretreatment with cilostazol (10-30 $\mu$M) or resveratrol (20 $\mu$M) prevented these A$\beta$1-42 evoked suppressions. LC3-II (a marker of mammalian autophagy) levels were significantly increased by cilostazol, and this increase was reduced by 3-methyladenine. To evoke endogenous A$\beta$ overproduction, N2aSwe cells (N2a cells stably expressing human APP containing the Swedish mutation) were cultured in medium with or without tetracycline (Tet+ for 48 h and then placed in Tet-condition). A$\beta$ and APP-CTF$\beta$ expressions were increased after 12∼24 h in Tet-condition, and these increased expressions were significantly reduced by pretreating cilostazol. Cilostazol-induced reductions in the expressions of A$\beta$ and APP-CTF$\beta$ were blocked by bafilomycin A1 (a blocker of autophagosome to lysosome fusion). After knockdown of the SIRT1 gene (to ∼40{\%} in SIRT1 protein), cilostazol failed to elevate the expressions of beclin-1, Atg5, and LC3-II, indicating that cilostazol increases these expressions by up-regulating SIRT1. Further, decreased cell viability induced by A$\beta$ was prevented by cilostazol, and this inhibition was reversed by 3-methyladenine, indicating that the protective effect of cilostazol against A$\beta$ induced neurotoxicity is, in part, ascribable to the induction of autophagy. In conclusion, cilostazol modulates autophagy by increasing the activation of SIRT1, and thereby enhances A$\beta$ clearance and increases cell viability. Copyright:},

	Abstract = {A key event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is the conversion of the peptide beta-amyloid (A??) from its soluble monomeric form into various aggregated morphologies in the brain. Preventing aggregation of A?? is being actively pursued as a primary therapeutic strategy for treating AD. Trehalose, a simple disaccharide, has been shown to be effective in preventing the deactivation of numerous proteins and in protecting cells against stress. Here, we show that trehalose is also effective in inhibiting aggregation of A?? and reducing its cytotoxicity, although it shows differential effects toward A??40 and A??42. When co-incubated with A??40, trehalose inhibits formation of both fibrillar and oligomeric morphologies as determined by fluorescence staining and atomic force microscopy (AFM). However, when co-incubated with A??42, trehalose inhibits formation only of the fibrillar morphology, with significant oligomeric formation still present. When aggregated mixtures were incubated with SH-SY5Y cells, trehalose was shown to reduce the toxicity of A??40 mixtures, but not A??42. These results provide additional evidence that aggregation of A?? into soluble oligomeric forms is a pathological step in AD and that A??42 in particular is more susceptible to forming these toxic oligomers than A??40. These results also suggest that the use of trehalose, a highly soluble, low-priced sugar, as part of a potential therapeutic cocktail to control A?? peptide aggregation and toxicity warrants further study. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Modulating the tau level may represent a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD), as accumulating evidence shows that Abeta-induced neurodegeneration is mediated by tau. It is therefore important to understand the expression and degradation of tau in neurons. Recently we showed that overexpressed mutant tau and tau aggregates are degraded via the autophagic pathway in an N2a cell model. Here we investigated whether autophagy is involved in the degradation of endogenous tau in cultured primary neurons. We activated this pathway in primary neurons with trehalose, an enhancer of autophagy. This resulted in the reduction of endogenous tau protein. Tau phosphorylation at several sites elevated in AD pathology had little influence on its degradation by autophagy. Furthermore, by using a neuronal cell model of tauopathy, we showed that activation of autophagy suppresses tau aggregation and eliminates cytotoxicity. Notably, apart from activating autophagy, trehalose also inhibits tau aggregation directly. Thus, trehalose may be a good candidate for developing therapeutic strategies for AD and other tauopathies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Background: This study was proposed to compare the efficacy and safety of GTM-1, Rapamycin (Rap), and Carbamazepine (CBZ) in managing Alzheimer disease (AD). The impact of the above mentioned therapeutic drugs on autophagy was also investigated in our study. Material/Methods: Firstly, 3×Tg AD mice were randomly allocated into 4 groups (each group with 10 mice), in which AD mice were separately treated with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, vehicle group), GTM-1 (6 mg/kg), Rap (1 mg/kg), and CBZ (100 mg/kg). Then spatial memory and learning ability of mice was tested using the Morris water maze. Routine blood tests were performed to evaluate the toxicity of these drugs. Amyloid-$\beta$42 (A$\beta$42) concentration was detected by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Proteins related to autophagy were detected by Western blot. Results: GTM-1, Rap, and CBZ significantly improved the spatial memory of 3×Tg AD mice compared to that in the vehicle group (all P {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, this study revealed that CBZ dosage was related to toxicity in mice. All of the above drugs significantly increased the expression of LC3-II and reduced A$\beta$42 levels in hippocampi of 3×Tg AD mice (all P {\textless} 0.05). On the other hand, neither GTM-1 nor CBZ had significant influence on the expression of proteins on the mTOR pathway. Conclusions: GTM-1 can alleviate the AD syndrome by activating autophagy in a manner that is dependent on the mTOR pathway and it therefore can be considered as an alternative to Rap.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. When macroautophagy (autophagy) is induced by nutrient starvation or rapamycin treatment, Atg (autophagy-related) proteins are assembled at a restricted region close to the vacuole. Subsequently, the phagophore expands to form a closed autophagosome. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells overexpressing precursor Ape1 (prApe1), a specific autophagosome cargo protein, the phagophore can be visualized as a cup-shaped structure labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Atg8. Previously, our group has shown that the maximum length of GFP-Atg8-labeled structures reflects the magnitude of bulk autophagy. In that study, the morphological parameters of the autophagy-related structures were extracted manually, requiring a great deal of time. Moreover, only well-expanded phagophores were subjected to further analysis. Here we report Qautas (Quantitative autophagy-related structure analysis system), a high-throughput and comprehensive system for morphological analysis of autophagy-related structures using a combination of image processing and machine learning. We describe both the manual method and Qautas in detail.},

The previous study showed cilostazolmodulates autophagy by increasing beclin1, Atg5 and LC3-II expressions, and depletes intracellular A$\beta$ accumulation. This study elucidated themechanisms through which cilostazolmodulates the autophagic degradation ofA$\beta$ in neurons. InN2a cells, cilostazol (10--30 $\mu$M), significantly increased the expression of P-AMPK$\alpha$ (Thr 172) and downstreamP-ACC(acetyl-CoA carboxylase) (Ser 79) as did resveratrol (SIRT1 activator), or AICAR(AMPK activator),whichwere blocked by KT5720, compoundC(AMPK inhibitor), or sirtinol. Furthermore, phosphorylated-mTOR(Ser 2448) and phosphorylated-P70S6K(Thr 389) expressionswere suppressed, and LC3-II levels were elevated in associationwith decreased P62/Sqstm1by cilostazol.Cilostazol increased cathepsinB activity and decreased p62/SQSTM1, consequently decreased accumulation of A$\beta$1--42 in the activatedN2aSwe cells, and these resultswere blocked by sirtinol, compound Cand bafilomycinA1 (autophagosome blocker), suggesting enhanced autophagosome for- mation by cilostazol. In SIRT1 gene-silencedN2a cells, cilostazol failed to increase the expressions of P-LKB1 (Ser 428) andP-AMPK$\alpha$,which contrastedwith its effect in negative control cells transfectedwith scrambled siRNA duplex. Further,N2a cells transfectedwith expression vectors encoding pcDNA SIRT1 showed increased P-AMPK$\alpha$ expression,which mimicked the effect of cilostazol inN2a cells; suggesting cilostazol-stimulated expressions of P-LKB1 and P-AMPK$\alpha$were SIRT1-dependent.Unlike their effects inN2a cells, inHeLa cells, which lack LKB1, cilostazol and resveratrol did not elevate SIRT1 orP-AMPK$\alpha$ expression, indicating cilostazol and resveratrol-stimulated expressions of SIRT1 and P-AMPK$\alpha$ are LKB1-dependent. In conclusion, cilostazol upregulates autophagy by activating SIRT1-cou- pledP-LKB1/P-AMPK$\alpha$ and inhibitingmTORactivation, thereby decreasing A$\beta$ accumulation.},
