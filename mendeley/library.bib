abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autophagy is a dynamic process during which isolation membranes package substrates to form autophagosomes that are fused with lysosomes to form autolysosomes for degradation. Although it is agreed that the LC3II-associated mature autophagosomes move along microtubular tracks, it is still in dispute if the conversion of LC3I to LC3II before autophagosomes are fully mature and subsequent fusion of mature autophagosomes with lysosomes require microtubules.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We use biochemical markers of autophagy and a collection of microtubule interfering reagents to test the question. Results show that interruption of microtubules with either microtubule stabilizing paclitaxel or destabilizing nocodazole similarly impairs the conversion of LC3I to LC3II, but does not block the degradation of LC3II-associated autophagosomes. Acetylation of microtubules renders them resistant to nocodazole treatment. Treatment with vinblastine that causes depolymerization of both non-acetylated and acetylated microtubules results in impairment of both LC3I-LC3II conversion and LC3II-associated autophagosome fusion with lysosomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Acetylated microtubules are required for fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolysosomes.},

abstract = {The extensive autophagic-lysosomal pathology in Alzheimer disease (AD) brain has revealed a major defect: in the proteolytic clearance of autophagy substrates. Autophagy failure contributes on several levels to AD pathogenesis and has become an important therapeutic target for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. We recently observed broad therapeutic effects of stimulating autophagic-lysosomal proteolysis in the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD that exhibits defective proteolytic clearance of autophagic substrates, robust intralysosomal amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$) accumulation, extracellular $\beta$-amyloid deposition and cognitive deficits. By genetically deleting the lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin B (CstB), to selectively restore depressed cathepsin activities, we substantially cleared A$\beta$, ubiquitinated proteins and other autophagic substrates from autolysosomes/lysosomes and rescued autophagic-lysosomal pathology, as well as reduced total A$\beta$40/42 levels and extracellular amyloid deposition, highlighting the underappreciated importance of the lysosomal system for A$\beta$ clearance. Most importantly, lysosomal remediation prevented the marked learning and memory deficits in TgCRND8 mice. Our findings underscore the pathogenic significance of autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction in AD and demonstrate the value of reversing this dysfunction as an innovative therapeautic strategy for AD.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder initiated by the aggregation of amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$). Macroautophagy, which is essential for cell survival as well as the promotion of cell death, has been observed extensively in AD brains or transgenic mice overexpressing A$\beta$ protein precursor. However, the role of macroautophagy in the pathogenesis of AD is unclear. In this study, we showed that A$\beta$1−42 triggered autophagic cell death in both human glioma cell line (U87 cell) and human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y cell). A$\beta$1−42-induced cytotoxicity and autophagic cell death were blocked by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or by small interfering RNA against the autophagy gene Beclin-1. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was also detected in both A$\beta$1−42 treated cell lines and this accumulation was not affected by 3-MA. Moreover, pretreatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine inhibited ROS accumulation and autophagic cell death induced by A$\beta$1−42, suggesting that A$\beta$1−42-induced ROS accumulation might trigger the onset of autophagy and subsequent autophagic cell death. These findings provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying A$\beta$-induced cytotoxicity.},

abstract = {The antifungal, immunosuppressive compound rapamycin arrests the cell cycle in G1 in both yeast cells and T-lymphocytes. Previous genetic studies in yeast identified mutations in three genes, FPR1 (FKBP12), TOR1, and TOR2, which confer rapamycin resistance, and genetic findings implicated the TOR proteins as direct targets of FKBP12-rapamycin. Consistent with this model, we find that modulating TOR1 and TOR2 expression alters rapamycin sensitivity. We describe several TOR2 mutations that confer rapamycin resistance. These mutations prevent FKBP12-rapamycin binding to TOR2, as assayed with the two-hybrid system. We find that TOR1 and the mammalian TOR homologue (mTOR) also bind FKBP12-rapamycin, and mutations corresponding to those in TOR2 similarly block FKBP12-rapamycin binding. We demonstrate that FKBP12 prolyl isomerase activity is not required for FKBP12-rapamycin binding to TOR and that a composite protein-drug surface contacts the TOR proteins. These studies confirm that the TOR proteins are direct targets of FKBP12-rapamycin, reveal that drug-resistant mutations prevent this association, and define structural features of these complexes.},

abstract = {Environmental exposure to paraquat has been reported to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). In experimental animal models paraquat reproduces features of PD, however, the exact mechanism of PD-induced neurotoxicity has not been fully established. This study was designed to investigate paraquat-mediated interference with mitochondrial function and autophagy, and determine the impact of the modulation of autophagy flux on paraquat-induced cell toxicity. Rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were treated with paraquat for 24 h to establish a cellular mode of PD induced neurotoxicity. Pre-incubation of PC12 cells with an antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or autophagy modulators rapamycin and chloroquine was conducted to determine the effect of modulation of oxidative status and autophagy flux on paraquat-elicited cytotoxicity. Mitochondrial functions and dynamics were analyzed by measuring oxygen consumption in a high-resolution oxygraph and imaging with a fluorescent mitochondrial dye (MitoTracker). Reactive oxygen species was determined by flow cytometry using fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. Autophagic flux was determined by Western blot analysis of autophagy marker LC3-II as well as p62 expression. It was found that treatment of cells with paraquat caused a concentration-dependent loss of cell viability that was accompanied by a decrease in cell respiration and reduction of polarized mitochondria, which was prevented by pretreatment of cells with NAC. Analysis of autophagy showed that NAC inhibited basic autophagy flux of PC12 cells, as evidenced by a decrease in LC3-II level and an increase in p62 expression. However, this modulation of autophagy by NAC may not be implicated into its cellular protective mechanism over paraquat cytotoxicity as inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine significantly enhanced paraquat induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the autophagy inducer rapamycin dramatically decreased paraquat induced cellular toxicity in PC12 cells. The present study demonstrates that basal autophagy plays a protective role in paraquat-induced cell toxicity. Antioxidant NAC confers protective role in paraquat toxicity mainly through maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and function, other than a modulation of autophagy flux.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder caused by fully penetrant single gene mutations in a minority of cases, while the majority of cases are sporadic or show modest familial clustering. These cases are of late onset and likely result from the interaction of many genes and the environment. More than 30 loci have been implicated in AD by a combination of linkage, genome-wide association, and whole genome/exome sequencing. We have learned from these studies that perturbations in endolysosomal, lipid metabolism, and immune response pathways substantially contribute to sporadic AD pathogenesis. We review here current knowledge about functions of AD susceptibility genes, highlighting cells of the myeloid lineage as drivers of at least part of the genetic component in late-onset AD. Although targeted resequencing utilized for the identification of causal variants has discovered coding mutations in some AD-associated genes, a lot of risk variants lie in noncoding regions. Here we discuss the use of functional genomics approaches that integrate transcriptomic, epigenetic, and endophenotype traits with systems biology to annotate genetic variants, and to facilitate discovery of AD risk genes. Further validation in cell culture and mouse models will be necessary to establish causality for these genes. This knowledge will allow mechanism-based design of novel therapeutic interventions in AD and promises coherent implementation of treatment in a personalized manner.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a dynamic cellular pathway involved in the turnover of proteins, protein complexes, and organelles through lysosomal degradation. The integrity of postmitotic neurons is heavily dependent on high basal autophagy compared to non-neuronal cells as misfolded proteins and damaged organelles cannot be diluted through cell division. Moreover, neurons contain the specialized structures for intercellular communication, such as axons, dendrites and synapses, which require the reciprocal transport of proteins, organelles and autophagosomes over significant distances from the soma. Defects in autophagy affect the intercellular communication and subsequently, contributing to neurodegeneration. The presence of abnormal autophagic activity is frequently observed in selective neuronal populations afflicted in common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These observations have provoked controversy regarding whether the increase in autophagosomes observed in the degenerating neurons play a protective role or instead contribute to pathogenic neuronal cell death. It is still unknown what factors may determine whether active autophagy is beneficial or pathogenic during neurodegeneration. In this review, we consider both the normal and pathophysiological roles of neuronal autophagy and its potential therapeutic implications for common neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {The aggregation of mutant polyglutamine (polyQ) proteins has sparked interest in the role of protein quality-control pathways in Huntington's disease (HD) and related polyQ disorders. Employing a novel knock-in HD mouse model, we provide in vivo evidence of early, sustained alterations of autophagy in response to mutant huntingtin (mhtt). The HdhQ200 knock-in model, derived from the selective breeding of HdhQ150 knock-in mice, manifests an accelerated and more robust phenotype than the parent line. Heterozygous HdhQ200 mice accumulate htt aggregates as cytoplasmic aggregation foci (AF) as early as 9 weeks of age and striatal neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) by 20 weeks. By 40 weeks, striatal AF are perinuclear and immunoreactive for ubiquitin and the autophagosome marker LC3. Striatal NIIs accumulate earlier in HdhQ200 mice than in HdhQ150 mice. The earlier appearance of aggregate pathology in HdhQ200 mice is paralleled by earlier and more rapidly progressive motor deficits: progressive imbalance and decreased motor coordination by 50 weeks, gait deficits by 60 weeks and gross motor impairment by 80 weeks of age. At 80 weeks, heterozygous HdhQ200 mice exhibit striatal and cortical astrogliosis and a approximately 50{\%} reduction in striatal dopamine receptor binding. Increased LC3-II protein expression, which is noted early and sustained throughout the disease course, is paralleled by increased expression of the autophagy-related protein, p62. Early and sustained expression of autophagy-related proteins in this genetically precise mouse model of HD suggests that the alteration of autophagic flux is an important and early component of the neuronal response to mhtt.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a membrane trafficking pathway that carries cytosolic components to the lysosome for degradation. During this process, the autophagosome, a double-membraned organelle, is generated de novo, sequesters cytoplasmic proteins and organelles, and delivers them to lysosomes. However, the mechanism by which autophagosomes are targeted to lysosomes has not been determined. Here, we observed the real-time behavior of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), which localizes to autophagosomes, and showed that autophagosomes move in a microtubule-and dynein-dynactin motor complex-dependent manner. After formation, autophagosomes show a rapid vectorial movement in the direction of the centrosome, where lysosomes are usually concentrated. Microinjection of antibodies against LC3 inhibited this movement; furthermore, using FRAP, we showed that anti-LC3 antibody injection caused a defect in targeting of autophagosomes to lysosomes. Collectively, our data demonstrate the functional significance of autophagosome movement that enables effective delivery from the cytosol to lysosomes.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a process for the bulk degradation of proteins, in which cytoplasmic components of the cell are enclosed by double-membrane structures known as autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes or vacuoles for degradation. This process is crucial for survival during starvation and cell differentiation. No molecules have been identified that are involved in autophagy in higher eukaryotes. We have isolated 14 autophagy-defective (apg) mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and examined the autophagic process at the molecular level. We show here that a unique covalent-modification system is essential for autophagy to occur. The carboxy-terminal glycine residue of Apg12, a 186-amino-acid protein, is conjugated to a lysine at residue 149 of Apg5, a 294-amino-acid protein. Of the apg mutants, we found that apg7 and apg10 were unable to form an Apg5/Apg12 conjugate. By cloning APG7, we discovered that Apg7 is a ubiquitin-E1-like enzyme. This conjugation can be reconstituted in vitro and depends on ATP. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a protein unrelated to ubiquitin that uses a ubiquitination-like conjugation system. Furthermore, Apg5 and Apg12 have mammalian homologues, suggesting that this new modification system is conserved from yeast to mammalian cells.},

@article{Nixon2006,
abstract = {Autophagy, a lysosomal pathway for degrading organelles and long-lived proteins, is becoming recognized as a key adaptive response that can preclude death in stressed or diseased cells. However, during development strong induction of autophagy in specific cell populations mediates a type of programmed cell death that has distinctive 'autophagic' morphology and a requirement for autophagy activity. The recent identification of autophagosomes in neurons in a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders has, therefore, sparked controversy about whether these structures are contributing to neuronal cell death or protecting against it. Emerging evidence supports the view that induction of autophagy is a neuroprotective response and that inadequate or defective autophagy, rather than excessive autophagy, promotes neuronal cell death in most of these disorders. In this review, we consider possible mechanisms underlying autophagy-associated cell death and their relationship to pathways mediating apoptosis and necrosis. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Lactate metabolism in the adult rat brain was investigated in relation with the concept of lactate trafficking between astrocytes and neurons. Wistar rats were infused intravenously with a solution containing either [3-(13)C]lactate (534 mM) or both glucose (750 mM) and [3-(13)C]lactate (534 mM). The time courses of both the concentration and (13)C enrichment of blood glucose and lactate were determined. The data indicated the occurrence of [3-(13)C]lactate recycling through liver gluconeogenesis. The yield of glucose labeling was, however, reduced when using the glucose-containing infusate. After a 20-min or 1-h infusion, perchloric acid extracts of the brain tissue were prepared and subsequently analyzed by (13)C- and (1)H-observed/(13)C-edited NMR spectroscopy. The (13)C labeling of amino acids indicated that [3-(13)C]lactate was metabolized in the brain. Based on the alanine C3 enrichment, lactate contribution to brain metabolism amounted to 35{\%} under the most favorable conditions used. By contrast with what happens with [1-(13)C]glucose metabolism, no difference in glutamine C2 and C3 labeling was evidenced, indicating that lactate was metabolized in a compartment deprived of pyruvate carboxylase activity. This result confirms, for the first time from an in vivo study, that lactate is more specifically a neuronal substrate.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a ubiquitous cellular mechanism for the targeted lysosomal degradation of various cytosolic constituents, from proteins to organelles. As an essential homeostatic mechanism, autophagy is upregulated in response to numerous environmental and pharmacological stimuli, including starvation, where it facilitates the recycling of essential amino acids. In addition, autophagy plays specific roles within the immune system; it serves as a source of peptides for antigen presentation, a mechanism for the engulfment and degradation of intracellular pathogens and as a key regulator of inflammatory cytokines. In particular, autophagy has been shown to play a number of roles in regulating inflammasome activation, from the removal of inflammasome-activating endogenous signals, to the sequestration and degradation of inflammasome components. Autophagy also plays a role in determining the fate of IL-1$\beta$, which is concentrated in autophagosomes. This review discusses a growing body of literature that suggests autophagy is a critical regulator of inflammasome activation and the subsequent release of IL-1 family cytokines.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease is primarily a movement disorder with predilection for the nigral dopaminergic neurons and is often associated with widespread neurodegeneration and diffuse Lewy body deposition. Recent advances in molecular genetics and studies in model organisms have transformed our understanding of Parkinson's pathogenesis and suggested unifying biochemical pathways despite the clinical heterogeneity of the disease. In this review, we summarized the evidence that a number of Parkinson's associated genetic mutations or polymorphisms (. LRRK2, VPS35, GBA, ATP13A2, ATP6AP2, DNAJC13/RME-8, RAB7L1, GAK) disrupt protein trafficking and degradation via the endosomal pathway and discussed how such defects could arise from or contribute to the accumulation and misfolding of ??-synuclein in Lewy bodies. We propose that an age-related pathological depletion of functional endolysosomes due to neuromelanin deposition in dopaminergic neurons may increase their susceptibility to stochastic molecular defects in this pathway and we discuss how enzymes that regulate ubiquitin signaling, as exemplified by the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, could provide the missing link between genetic and acquired defects in endosomal trafficking. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Neuronal Protein'.},

Here we show that oral supplementation of the natural polyamine spermidine extends the lifespan of mice and exerts cardioprotective effects, reducing cardiac hypertrophy and preserving diastolic function in old mice. Spermidine feeding enhanced cardiac autophagy, mitophagy and mitochondrial respiration, and it also improved the mechano-elastical properties of cardiomyocytes in vivo, coinciding with increased titin phosphorylation and suppressed subclinical inflammation. Spermidine feeding failed to provide cardioprotection in mice that lack the autophagy-related protein Atg5 in cardiomyocytes. In Dahl salt-sensitive rats that were fed a high-salt diet, a model for hypertension-induced congestive heart failure, spermidine feeding reduced systemic blood pressure, increased titin phosphorylation and prevented cardiac hypertrophy and a decline in diastolic function, thus delaying the progression to heart failure. In humans, high levels of dietary spermidine, as assessed from food questionnaires, correlated with reduced blood pressure and a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. Our results suggest a new and feasible strategy for protection against cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Alpha-synuclein mutations have been identified in certain families with Parkinson's disease (PD), and alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies. Other genetic data indicate that the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system is involved in PD pathogenesis. We have generated stable PC12 cell lines expressing wild-type or A53T mutant human alpha-synuclein. Lines expressing mutant but not wild-type alpha-synuclein show: (1) disruption of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system, manifested by small cytoplasmic ubiquitinated aggregates and by an increase in polyubiquitinated proteins; (2) enhanced baseline nonapoptotic death; (3) marked accumulation of autophagic-vesicular structures; (4) impairment of lysosomal hydrolysis and proteasomal function; and (5) loss of catecholamine-secreting dense core granules and an absence of depolarization-induced dopamine release. Such findings raise the possibility that the primary abnormality in these cells may involve one or more deficits in the lysosomal and/or proteasomal degradation pathways, which in turn lead to loss of dopaminergic capacity and, ultimately, to death. These cells may serve as a model to study the effects of aberrant alpha-synuclein on dopaminergic cell function and survival.},

Levels of TBARS were elevated in all AD brain regions except the middle frontal gyrus, and elevation levels reached statistical significance in the hippocampus and pyriform cortex and marginal significance in the amygdala of AD subjects compared with age-matched controls. Significant elevation of GSH-Px activity was present in AD hippocampus compared with control. Moderate but statistically insignificant elevations of GSH-Px activity also were present in the amygdala and pyriform cortex in AD. GSSG-R activity was significantly elevated in the amygdala and hippocampus in AD subjects compared with controls. CAT activity was significantly elevated in AD hippocampus and superior and middle temporal gyri. SOD levels were elevated in all brain regions in AD patients compared with controls, although none of these elevations reached statistical significance. Antioxidant enzyme activities were significantly elevated where lipid peroxidation was most pronounced, suggesting a compensatory rise in antioxidant activity in response to increased free radical formation. This study supports the concept that the brain in AD is under increased oxidative stress and demonstrates that the oxidative changes are most pronounced in the medial temporal lobe, where histopathologic alterations are most severe.},

@article{Valko2007,
abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS, e.g. nitric oxide, NO(*)) are well recognised for playing a dual role as both deleterious and beneficial species. ROS and RNS are normally generated by tightly regulated enzymes, such as NO synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. Overproduction of ROS (arising either from mitochondrial electron-transport chain or excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H) results in oxidative stress, a deleterious process that can be an important mediator of damage to cell structures, including lipids and membranes, proteins, and DNA. In contrast, beneficial effects of ROS/RNS (e.g. superoxide radical and nitric oxide) occur at low/moderate concentrations and involve physiological roles in cellular responses to noxia, as for example in defence against infectious agents, in the function of a number of cellular signalling pathways, and the induction of a mitogenic response. Ironically, various ROS-mediated actions in fact protect cells against ROS-induced oxidative stress and re-establish or maintain "redox balance" termed also "redox homeostasis". The "two-faced" character of ROS is clearly substantiated. For example, a growing body of evidence shows that ROS within cells act as secondary messengers in intracellular signalling cascades which induce and maintain the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, however, ROS can also induce cellular senescence and apoptosis and can therefore function as anti-tumourigenic species. This review will describe the: (i) chemistry and biochemistry of ROS/RNS and sources of free radical generation; (ii) damage to DNA, to proteins, and to lipids by free radicals; (iii) role of antioxidants (e.g. glutathione) in the maintenance of cellular "redox homeostasis"; (iv) overview of ROS-induced signaling pathways; (v) role of ROS in redox regulation of normal physiological functions, as well as (vi) role of ROS in pathophysiological implications of altered redox regulation (human diseases and ageing). Attention is focussed on the ROS/RNS-linked pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), rheumatoid arthritis, and ageing. Topics of current debate are also reviewed such as the question whether excessive formation of free radicals is a primary cause or a downstream consequence of tissue injury.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a catabolic process in which lysosomes degrade intracytoplasmic contents transported in double-membraned autophagosomes. Autophagosomes are formed by the elongation and fusion of phagophores, which derive from pre-autophagosomal structures. The membrane origins of autophagosomes are unclear and may involve multiple sources, including the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Here we show in mammalian cells that the heavy chain of clathrin interacts with Atg16L1 and is involved in the formation of Atg16L1-positive early autophagosome precursors. Atg16L1 associated with clathrin-coated structures, and inhibition of clathrin-mediated internalization decreased the formation of both Atg16L1-positive precursors and mature autophagosomes. We tested and demonstrated that the plasma membrane contributes directly to the formation of early Atg16L1-positive autophagosome precursors. This may be particularly important during periods of increased autophagosome formation, because the plasma membrane may serve as a large membrane reservoir that allows cells periods of autophagosome synthesis at levels many-fold higher than under basal conditions, without compromising other processes.},

abstract = {One of the major neuropathological findings in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a loss of synaptic contacts in both the neocortex and hippocampus. Here we report, for the first time, an estimate of the total number of synapses in the outer molecular layer (OML) of the human dentate gyrus, in individuals with early Alzheimer's disease (eAD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or no cognitive impairment (NCI). An unbiased stereologic sampling scheme coupled with transmission electron microscopy to directly visualize synaptic contacts, was used to estimate the total number of synapses in short postmortem autopsy tissue. Individuals with eAD had significantly fewer synapses than the other two diagnostic groups. Seventy-five percent of the individuals with MCI had synaptic values that were lower than the NCI group mean. The number of synapses showed a significant correlation with the subject's Mini-Mental State score and with cognitive tests involving delayed recall. Synaptic loss showed no relationship to Braak stage or to apoE genotype. The volume of the OML was significantly reduced in eAD compared to the other two diagnositic groups that were not different from each other. These data suggest that a loss of afferents from the entorhinal cortex underlie the synapse loss seen in eAD. This study supports the concept that synapse loss is an early event in the disease process and suggests that MCI may be a transition stage between eAD and NCI with synaptic loss a structural correlate involved in cognitive decline.},

abstract = {In the 50 years since we described cell death as 'programmed,' we have come far, thanks to the efforts of many brilliant researchers, and we now understand the mechanics, the biochemistry, and the genetics of many of the ways in which cells can die. This knowledge gives us the resources to alter the fates of many cells. However, not all cells respond similarly to the same stimulus, in either sensitivity to the stimulus or timing of the response. Cells prevented from dying through one pathway may survive, survive in a crippled state, or die following a different pathway. To fully capitalize on our knowledge of cell death, we need to understand much more about how cells are targeted to die and what aspects of the history, metabolism, or resources available to individual cells determine how each cell reaches and crosses the threshold at which it commits to death.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The pathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid plaques [aggregates of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$)] and neurofibrillary tangles (aggregates of tau). Growing evidence suggests that tau accumulation is pathologically more relevant to the development of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD patients than A$\beta$ plaques. Oxidative stress is a prominent early event in the pathogenesis of AD and is therefore believed to contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation. Several studies have shown that the autophagic pathway in neurons is important under physiological and pathological conditions. Therefore, this pathway plays a crucial role for the degradation of endogenous soluble tau. However, the relationship between oxidative stress, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, autophagy dysregulation, and neuronal cell death in AD remains unclear. Here, we review the latest progress in AD, with a special emphasis on oxidative stress, tau hyperphosphorylation, and autophagy. We also discuss the relationship of these three factors in AD.},

Mitochondria are critical regulators of cell death, a key feature of neurodegeneration. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA and oxidative stress both contribute to ageing, which is the greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. In all major examples of these diseases there is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early and acts causally in disease pathogenesis. Moreover, an impressive number of disease-specific proteins interact with mitochondria. Thus, therapies targeting basic mitochondrial processes, such as energy metabolism or free-radical generation, or specific interactions of disease-related proteins with mitochondria, hold great promise.},

Here, we report that administration of spermidine, a natural polyamine whose intracellular concentration declines during human ageing, markedly extended the lifespan of yeast, flies and worms, and human immune cells. In addition, spermidine administration potently inhibited oxidative stress in ageing mice. In ageing yeast, spermidine treatment triggered epigenetic deacetylation of histone H3 through inhibition of histone acetyltransferases (HAT), suppressing oxidative stress and necrosis. Conversely, depletion of endogenous polyamines led to hyperacetylation, generation of reactive oxygen species, early necrotic death and decreased lifespan. The altered acetylation status of the chromatin led to significant upregulation of various autophagy-related transcripts, triggering autophagy in yeast, flies, worms and human cells. Finally, we found that enhanced autophagy is crucial for polyamine-induced suppression of necrosis and enhanced longevity.},

In the US alone, Alzheimer disease (AD) - the most frequent cause of dementia characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function in particular the memory domain - causes estimated health-care costs of {\$} 172 billion per year. Key neuropathological hallmarks of the AD brain are diffuse and neuritic extracellular amyloid plaques - often surrounded by dystrophic neurites - and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological changes are frequently accompanied by reactive microgliosis and loss of neurons, white matter and synapses. The etiological mechanisms underlying these neuropathological changes remain unclear, but are probably caused by both environmental and genetic factors. In this review article, we provide an overview of the epidemiology of AD, review the biomarkers that may be used for risk assessment and in diagnosis, and give suggestions for future research.},

Here, we demonstrate that TLN is not a substrate for gamma-secretase cleavage, but displays a prolonged half-life in PS1(-/-) hippocampal neurons. TLN accumulates in intracellular structures bearing characteristics of autophagic vacuoles including the presence of Apg12p and LC3. Importantly, the TLN accumulations are suppressed by adenoviral expression of wild-type, FAD-linked and D257A mutant PS1, indicating that this phenotype is independent from gamma-secretase activity. Cathepsin D deficiency also results in the localization of TLN to autophagic vacuoles. TLN mediates the uptake of microbeads concomitant with actin and PIP2 recruitment, indicating a phagocytic origin of TLN accumulations. Absence of endosomal/lysosomal proteins suggests that the TLN-positive vacuoles fail to fuse with endosomes/lysosomes, preventing their acidification and further degradation. Collectively, PS1 deficiency affects in a gamma-secretase-independent fashion the turnover of TLN through autophagic vacuoles, most likely by an impaired capability to fuse with lysosomes.},

Dysfunction of the autophagy-lysosome system also contributes to A$\beta$ accumulation and the formation of tau oligomers and insoluble aggregates, because induction of autophagy enhances the clearance of both soluble and aggregated forms of A$\beta$ and tau proteins. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a central role in controlling protein homeostasis and negatively regulates autophagy. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin improves cognitive deficits and rescues A$\beta$ pathology and NFTs by increasing autophagy. Several mTOR signaling components may be potential biomarkers of cognitive impairment in the clinical diagnosis of AD. Thus, mTOR-related agents through the control of autophagy-lysosome protein degradation are emerging as an important therapeutic target for AD.},

Recently, autophagy has been implicated in neurodegeneration, but whether it is detrimental or protective remains unclear. Here we report that beclin 1, a protein with a key role in autophagy, was decreased in affected brain regions of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) early in the disease process. Heterozygous deletion of beclin 1 (Becn1) in mice decreased neuronal autophagy and resulted in neurodegeneration and disruption of lysosomes. In transgenic mice that express human amyloid precursor protein (APP), a model for AD, genetic reduction of Becn1 expression increased intraneuronal amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation, extracellular Abeta deposition, and neurodegeneration and caused microglial changes and profound neuronal ultrastructural abnormalities. Administration of a lentiviral vector expressing beclin 1 reduced both intracellular and extracellular amyloid pathology in APP transgenic mice. We conclude that beclin 1 deficiency disrupts neuronal autophagy, modulates APP metabolism, and promotes neurodegeneration in mice and that increasing beclin 1 levels may have therapeutic potential in AD.},

Some of them, including Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, Interferon-gamma-inducible Protein-10, Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 and Interleukin-8, are increased in AD and in Mild Cognitive Impairment, considered the prodromal stage of AD, suggesting that these modifications occur very early during the development of the disease, possibly explaining the failure of trials with anti-inflammatory agents in patients with severe AD. Further evidence suggests that cytokines and chemokines could play a role in other neurodegenerative disorders. These disorders are considered multifactorial diseases, and genetic factors influence pathological events and contribute to change the disease phenotype from patient to patient. Gene polymorphisms in crucial molecules, including cytokines, chemokines and molecules related to oxidative stress, may act as susceptibility factors, or may operate as regulatory factors, modulating the severity of pathogenic processes.},

While soluble A$\beta$ and tau represent toxic species in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, there is well documented evidence that plaques and tangles also are detrimental to normal brain function. Thus, it is critical to assess the effects of inducing autophagy in an animal model with established plaques and tangles. Here we show that rapamycin, when given prophylactically to 2-month-old 3xTg-AD mice throughout their life, induces autophagy and significantly reduces plaques, tangles and cognitive deficits. In contrast, inducing autophagy in 15-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, which have established plaques and tangles, has no effects on AD-like pathology and cognitive deficits. In conclusion, we show that autophagy induction via rapamycin may represent a valid therapeutic strategy in AD when administered early in the disease progression.},

Prior studies have shown that lipid storage in NPC disease induces autophagy. Here, we additionally show that the clearance of autophagosomes in NPC1 deficiency is impaired due to inhibition of lysosomal protease activity by stored lipids. We also demonstrate that the autophagic pathway is a source of stored cholesterol in the NPC lysosome, thus creating a positive feedback loop wherein autophagy induction exacerbates the disease via increased lipid storage. Inhibition of autophagy reduces cholesterol storage and restores normal lysosomal proteolysis in NPC1-deficient cells, supporting a model in which activation of the autophagic pathway promotes disease pathogenesis.},

Diseases with abnormal tau as part of the pathology are collectively known as the tauopathies. Methylthioninium chloride, also known as methylene blue (MB), has been shown to reduce tau levels in vitro and in vivo and several different mechanisms of action have been proposed. Herein we demonstrate that autophagy is a novel mechanism by which MB can reduce tau levels. Incubation with nanomolar concentrations of MB was sufficient to significantly reduce levels of tau both in organotypic brain slice cultures from a mouse model of FTD, and in cell models. Concomitantly, MB treatment altered the levels of LC3-II, cathepsin D, BECN1, and p62 suggesting that it was a potent inducer of autophagy. Further analysis of the signaling pathways induced by MB suggested a mode of action similar to rapamycin. Results were recapitulated in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy administered MB orally at three different doses for two weeks. These data support the use of this drug as a therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative diseases.},

While mechanistic understanding of PD is advancing, a treatment with well tolerable drugs is still elusive. Here, we show that administration of the naturally occurring polyamine spermidine, which declines continuously during aging in various species, alleviates a series of PD-related degenerative processes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two established model systems for PD pathology. In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human $\alpha$-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD. In this line, administration of spermidine rescued $\alpha$-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes. Alleviation of PD-related neurodegeneration by spermidine was accompanied by induction of autophagy, suggesting that this cytoprotective process may be responsible for the beneficial effects of spermidine administration.},

abstract = {Monitoring autophagic flux is important for the analysis of autophagy. Tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3 (mRFP-EGFP-LC3) is a convenient assay for monitoring autophagic flux based on different pH stability of EGFP and mRFP fluorescent proteins. However, it has been reported that there is still weak fluorescence of EGFP in acidic environments (pH between 4 and 5) or acidic lysosomes. So it is possible that autolysosomes are labeled with yellow signals (GFP(+)RFP(+) puncta), which results in misinterpreting autophagic flux results. Therefore, it is desirable to choose a monomeric green fluorescent protein that is more acid sensitive than EGFP in the assay of autophagic flux. Here, we report on an mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 reporter, in which mWasabi is more acid sensitive than EGFP and has no fluorescence in acidic lysosomes. Meanwhile, mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3$\Delta$G was constructed as the negative control for this assay. Compared with mRFP-EGFP-LC3, our results showed that this reporter is more sensitive and accurate in detecting the accumulation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Using this reporter, we find that high-dose rapamycin (30 $\mu$M) will impair autophagic flux, inducing many more autophagosomes than autolysosomes in HeLa cells, while low-dose rapamycin (500 nM) has an opposite effect. In addition, other chemical autophagy inducers (cisplatin, staurosporine and Z18) also elicit much more autophagosomes at high doses than those at low doses. Our results suggest that the dosage of chemical autophagy inducers would obviously influence autophagic flux in cells.},

abstract = {Autophagy protects organelles, cells, and organisms against several stress conditions. Induction of autophagy by resveratrol requires the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). In this paper, we show that the acetylase inhibitor spermidine stimulates autophagy independent of SIRT1 in human and yeast cells as well as in nematodes. Although resveratrol and spermidine ignite autophagy through distinct mechanisms, these compounds stimulate convergent pathways that culminate in concordant modifications of the acetylproteome. Both agents favor convergent deacetylation and acetylation reactions in the cytosol and in the nucleus, respectively. Both resveratrol and spermidine were able to induce autophagy in cytoplasts (enucleated cells). Moreover, a cytoplasm-restricted mutant of SIRT1 could stimulate autophagy, suggesting that cytoplasmic deacetylation reactions dictate the autophagic cascade. At doses at which neither resveratrol nor spermidine stimulated autophagy alone, these agents synergistically induced autophagy. Altogether, these data underscore the importance of an autophagy regulatory network of antagonistic deacetylases and acetylases that can be pharmacologically manipulated.},

abstract = {The brain's energy demands are remarkable both in their intensity and in their moment-to-moment dynamic range. This perspective considers the evidence for Warburg-like aerobic glycolysis during the transient metabolic response of the brain to acute activation, and it particularly addresses the cellular mechanisms that underlie this metabolic response. The temporary uncoupling between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation led to the proposal of an astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle whereby during stimulation, lactate produced by increased glycolysis in astrocytes is taken up by neurons as their primary energy source. However, direct evidence for this idea is lacking, and evidence rather supports that neurons have the capacity to increase their own glycolysis in response to stimulation; furthermore, neurons may export rather than import lactate in response to stimulation. The possible cellular mechanisms for invoking metabolic resupply of energy in neurons are also discussed, in particular the roles of feedback signaling via adenosine diphosphate and feedforward signaling by calcium ions.},

abstract = {When the food intake of organisms such as yeast and rodents is reduced (dietary restriction), they live longer than organisms fed a normal diet. A similar effect is seen when the activity of nutrient-sensing pathways is reduced by mutations or chemical inhibitors. In rodents, both dietary restriction and decreased nutrient-sensing pathway activity can lower the incidence of age-related loss of function and disease, including tumors and neurodegeneration. Dietary restriction also increases life span and protects against diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease in rhesus monkeys, and in humans it causes changes that protect against these age-related pathologies. Tumors and diabetes are also uncommon in humans with mutations in the growth hormone receptor, and natural genetic variants in nutrient-sensing pathways are associated with increased human life span. Dietary restriction and reduced activity of nutrient-sensing pathways may thus slow aging by similar mechanisms, which have been conserved during evolution. We discuss these findings and their potential application to prevention of age-related disease and promotion of healthy aging in humans, and the challenge of possible negative side effects.},

This process relieves the cell from various stress conditions. Autophagy plays a critical role during cellular development and differentiation, functions in tumor suppression, and may be linked to life span extension. Autophagy also has diverse roles in innate and adaptive immunity, such as resistance to pathogen invasion. Substantial progress has been made in the identification of many autophagy-related (ATG) genes that are essential to drive this cellular process, including both selective and nonselective types of autophagy. Identification of the ATG genes in yeast, and the finding of orthologs in other organisms, reveals the conservation of the autophagic machinery in all eukaryotes. Here, we summarize our current knowledge about the machinery and molecular mechanism of autophagy.},

abstract = {Lysosomes are organelles of eukaryotic cells that are critically involved in the degradation of macromolecules mainly delivered by endocytosis and autophagocytosis. Degradation is achieved by more than 60 hydrolases sequestered by a single phospholipid bilayer. The lysosomal membrane facilitates interaction and fusion with other compartments and harbours transport proteins catalysing the export of catabolites, thereby allowing their recycling. Lysosomal proteins have been addressed in various proteomic studies that are compared in this review regarding the source of material, the organelle/protein purification scheme, the proteomic methodology applied and the proteins identified. Distinguishing true constituents of an organelle from co-purifying contaminants is a central issue in subcellular proteomics, with additional implications for lysosomes as being the site of degradation of many cellular and extracellular proteins. Although many of the lysosomal hydrolases were identified by classical biochemical approaches, the knowledge about the protein composition of the lysosomal membrane has remained fragmentary for a long time. Using proteomics many novel lysosomal candidate proteins have been discovered and it can be expected that their functional characterisation will help to understand functions of lysosomes at a molecular level that have been characterised only phenomenologically so far and to generally deepen our understanding of this indispensable organelle.},

Here we demonstrate that the rat microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a homologue of Apg8p essential for autophagy in yeast, is associated to the autophagosome membranes after processing. Two forms of LC3, called LC3-I and -II, were produced post-translationally in various cells. LC3-I is cytosolic, whereas LC3-II is membrane bound. The autophagic vacuole fraction prepared from starved rat liver was enriched with LC3-II. Immunoelectron microscopy on LC3 revealed specific labelling of autophagosome membranes in addition to the cytoplasmic labelling. LC3-II was present both inside and outside of autophagosomes. Mutational analyses suggest that LC3-I is formed by the removal of the C-terminal 22 amino acids from newly synthesized LC3, followed by the conversion of a fraction of LC3-I into LC3-II. The amount of LC3-II is correlated with the extent of autophagosome formation. LC3-II is the first mammalian protein identified that specifically associates with autophagosome membranes.},

abstract = {PURPOSE. To assess the effects of spermidine on the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), with a focus on optic neuritis often associated with MS and EAE. METHODS. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced EAE mice were administered with or without spermidine at 30 mM in drinking water for 25 days. Clinical signs of EAE were scored daily, and visual functions were measured by multifocal electroretinograms. Histopathology analysis of the spinal cord and optic nerve was performed after mice were killed on day 25. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) was detected using the probe 2'-7' dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) in the optic nerve. The effect of spermidine on H 2 O 2 -induced retinal ganglion cell apoptosis was investigated by lactate dehydrogenase assay. RESULTS. Daily clinical scoring revealed that the severity of EAE was significantly attenuated in the spermidine-treated group, which was confirmed by milder demyelination and improved axon survival in the spinal cord of spermidine-treated mice. Visual functions were significantly improved in spermidinetreated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. Spermidine treatment ameliorated the extent of demyelination in the optic nerve and prevented cell loss in the retinal ganglion cell layer. Furthermore, fewer DCFDA-labeled cells were found in the optic nerve in the spermidine-treated EAE mice, and in vitro analysis revealed that spermidine reduced H 2 O 2 -induced retinal ganglion cell apoptosis, suggesting that spermidine alleviated the severities of EAE, particularly of optic neuritis, by acting as an antioxidant. CONCLUSIONS. The results from this study suggest that oral spermidine administration could be a useful treatment for MS. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.},

Exogenous supply of spermidine prolongs the life span of several model organisms including yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) and flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and significantly reduces age-related oxidative protein damage in mice, indicating that this agent may act as a universal anti-aging drug. Spermidine induces autophagy in cultured yeast and mammalian cells, as well as in nematodes and flies. Genetic inactivation of genes essential for autophagy abolishes the life span-prolonging effect of spermidine in yeast, nematodes and flies. These findings complement expanding evidence that autophagy mediates cytoprotection against a variety of noxious agents and can confer longevity when induced at the whole-organism level. We hypothesize that increased autophagic turnover of cytoplasmic organelles or long-lived proteins is involved in most if not all life span-prolonging therapies.},

abstract = {Background: Given the global increase in the aging population and age-related diseases, the promotion of healthy aging is one of the most crucial public health issues. This trial aims to contribute to the establishment of effective approaches to promote cognitive and brain health in older individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Presence of SCD is known to increase the risk of objective cognitive decline and progression to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is our primary goal to determine whether spermidine supplementation has a positive impact on memory performance in this at-risk group, as compared with placebo. The secondary goal is to examine the effects of spermidine intake on other neuropsychological, behavioral, and physiological parameters. Methods: The SmartAge trial is a monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb trial. The study will investigate 12 months of intervention with spermidine-based nutritional supplementation (target intervention) compared with 12 months of placebo intake (control intervention). We plan to recruit 100 cognitively normal older individuals with SCD from memory clinics, neurologists and general practitioners in private practice, and the general population. Participants will be allocated to one of the two study arms using blockwise randomization stratified by age and sex with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcome is the change in memory performance between baseline and post-intervention visits (12 months after baseline). Secondary outcomes include the change in memory performance from baseline to follow-up assessment (18 months after baseline), as well as changes in neurocognitive, behavioral, and physiological parameters (including blood and neuroimaging biomarkers), assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Discussion: The SmartAge trial aims to provide evidence of the impact of spermidine supplementation on memory performance in older individuals with SCD. In addition, we will identify possible neurophysiological mechanisms of action underlying the anticipated cognitive benefits. Overall, this trial will contribute to the establishment of nutrition intervention in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Pesticide exposure is a risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about how pesticide exposure may promote AD pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of paraquat pesticide exposure on $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) levels and cognition using wild-type (WT) mice and $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. Our results showed that wild-type mice and APP transgenic mice after paraquat exposure had increased oxidative damage specifically in mitochondria of cerebral cortex and exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the elevated mitochondrial damage was directly correlated with impaired associative learning and memory and increased A$\beta$ levels in APP transgenic mice exposed to paraquat. Furthermore, overexpression of peroxiredoxin 3, a mitochondrial antioxidant defense enzyme important for H2O2 removal, protected against paraquat-induced mitochondrial damage and concomitantly improved cognition and decreased A$\beta$ levels in APP transgenic mice. Therefore, our results demonstrate that mitochondrial damage is a key mechanism underlying cognitive impairment and elevated amyloidogenesis induced by paraquat and that enhanced removal of mitochondrial H2O2 could be an effective strategy to ameliorate AD pathogenesis induced by pesticide exposure. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Niemann-Pick C disease (NP-C) is a neurovisceral atypical lysosomal lipid storage disorder with an estimated minimal incidence of 1/120,000 live births. The broad clinical spectrum ranges from a neonatal rapidly fatal disorder to an adult-onset chronic neurodegenerative disease. The neurological involvement defines the disease severity in most patients but is typically preceded by systemic signs (cholestatic jaundice in the neonatal period or isolated spleno- or hepatosplenomegaly in infancy or childhood). The first neurological symptoms vary with age of onset: delay in developmental motor milestones (early infantile period), gait problems, falls, clumsiness, cataplexy, school problems (late infantile and juvenile period), and ataxia not unfrequently following initial psychiatric disturbances (adult form). The most characteristic sign is vertical supranuclear gaze palsy. The neurological disorder consists mainly of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and progressive dementia. Cataplexy, seizures and dystonia are other common features. NP-C is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations of either the NPC1 (95{\%} of families) or the NPC2 genes. The exact functions of the NPC1 and NPC2 proteins are still unclear. NP-C is currently described as a cellular cholesterol trafficking defect but in the brain, the prominently stored lipids are gangliosides. Clinical examination should include comprehensive neurological and ophthalmological evaluations. The primary laboratory diagnosis requires living skin fibroblasts to demonstrate accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in perinuclear vesicles (lysosomes) after staining with filipin. Pronounced abnormalities are observed in about 80{\%} of the cases, mild to moderate alterations in the remainder ("variant" biochemical phenotype). Genotyping of patients is useful to confirm the diagnosis in the latter patients and essential for future prenatal diagnosis. The differential diagnosis may include other lipidoses; idiopathic neonatal hepatitis and other causes of cholestatic icterus should be considered in neonates, and conditions with cerebellar ataxia, dystonia, cataplexy and supranuclear gaze palsy in older children and adults. Symptomatic management of patients is crucial. A first product, miglustat, has been granted marketing authorization in Europe and several other countries for specific treatment of the neurological manifestations. The prognosis largely correlates with the age at onset of the neurological manifestations.},

abstract = {Among age-related neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease (PD) represents the best example for which oxidative stress has been strongly implicated. The etiology of PD remains unknown, yet recent epidemiological studies have linked exposure to environmental agents, including pesticides, with an increased risk of developing the disease. As a result, the environmental hypothesis of PD has developed, which speculates that chemical agents in the environment are capable of producing selective dopaminergic cell death, thus contributing to disease development. The use of environmental agents such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, rotenone, paraquat, dieldrin, and maneb in toxicant-based models of PD has become increasingly popular and provided valuable insight into the neurodegenerative process. Understanding the unique and shared mechanisms by which these environmental agents act as selective dopaminergic toxicants is critical in identifying pathways involved in PD pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the neurotoxic properties of these compounds with specific focus on the induction of oxidative stress. We highlight landmark studies along with recent advances that support the role of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species from a variety of cellular sources as potent contributors to the neurotoxicity of these environmental agents. Finally, human risk and the implications of these studies in our understanding of PD-related neurodegeneration are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The accumulation of amyloid-??-containing neuritic plaques and intracellular tau protein tangles are key histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This type of pathology clearly indicates that the mechanisms of neuronal housekeeping and protein quality control are compromised in AD. There is mounting evidence that the autophagosome-lysosomal degradation is impaired, which could disturb the processing of APP and provoke AD pathology. Beclin 1 is a molecular platform assembling an interactome with stimulating and suppressive components which regulate the initiation of the autophagosome formation. Recent studies have indicated that the expression Beclin 1 is reduced in AD brain. Moreover, the deficiency of Beclin 1 in cultured neurons and transgenic mice provokes the deposition of amyloid-?? peptides whereas its overexpression reduces the accumulation of amyloid-??. There are several potential mechanisms, which could inhibit the function of Beclin 1 interactome and thus impair autophagy and promote AD pathology. The mechanisms include (i) reduction of Beclin 1 expression or its increased proteolytic cleavage by caspases, (ii) sequestration of Beclin 1 to non-functional locations, such as tau tangles, (iii) formation of inhibitory complexes between Beclin 1 and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins or inflammasomes, (iv) interaction of Beclin 1 with inhibitory neurovirulent proteins, e.g. herpex simplex ICP34.5, or (v) inhibition of the Beclin 1/Vps34 complex through the activation of CDK1 and CDK5. We will shortly introduce the function of Beclin 1 interactome in autophagy and phagocytosis, review the recent evidence indicating that Beclin 1 regulates autophagy and APP processing in AD, and finally examine the potential mechanisms through which Beclin 1 dysfunction could be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of bafilomycin A1, a potent and specific inhibitor of vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), on the process of autophagy in rat hepatoma cell line, H-4-II-E cells. To induce autophagy, cells were transferred from Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 12{\%} fetal calf serum into Hanks' balanced salt solution. When bafilomycin A1 was added to Hanks' balanced salt solution, endogenous protein degradation was strongly inhibited and numerous autophagosomes accumulated in H-4-II-E cells, whereas autolysosomes decreased in number. Acid phosphatase activity was not detected in the autophagosomes which accumulated in the presence of bafilomycin A1, suggesting that fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes was disturbed by this drug. Inhibition of the fusion was reversible, and the autophagosomes changed into autolysosomes after the removal of the inhibitor. Bafilomycin A1 also prevented the appearance of endocytosed HRP in autophagic vacuoles. These results suggested that acidification of the lumenal space of autophagosomes or lysosomes by V-ATPase is important for the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes.},

abstract = {The autophagy pathway is the major degradation pathway of the cell for long-lived proteins and organelles. Dysfunction of autophagy has been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders that are associated with an accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. Alzheimer's disease, the most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by 2 aggregate forms, tau tangles and amyloid-beta plaques. Autophagy has been linked to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis through its merger with the endosomal-lysosomal system, which has been shown to play a role in the formation of the latter amyloid-beta plaques. However, the precise role of autophagy in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis is still under contention. One hypothesis is that aberrant autophagy induction results in an accumulation of autophagic vacuoles containing amyloid-beta and the components necessary for its generation, whereas other evidence points to impaired autophagic clearance or even an overall reduction in autophagic activity playing a role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the current evidence linking autophagy to Alzheimer's disease as well as the uncertainty over the exact role and level of autophagic regulation in the pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Paraquat (PQ) is a potential human neurotoxicant and is used in models of oxidative stress. We determined the toxicokinetics (TK) and toxicodynamics (TD) of PQ in adult mouse brain following repeated or prolonged PQ exposure. PQ accumulated in different brain regions and reached a plateau after ∼ 18 i.p. (10 mg/kg) doses and resulted in modest morbidity and mortality unpredictably associated with dose interval and number. PQ had divergent effects on horizontal locomotor behavior depending on the number of doses. PQ decreased striatal dopamine levels after the 18th to 36th i.p. dose (10 mg/kg) and reduced the striatal level of tyrosine hydroxylase. Drinking water exposure to PQ (0.03- 0.05 mg/ml) did not result in any mortality and resulted in concentration and time dependent levels in the brain. The brain half-life of PQ varied with mouse strain. PQ accumulates and may saturate a site in mouse brain resulting in complex PQ level and duration-related consequences. These findings should alter our risk assessment of this compound and demonstrate a useful, but complex dynamic model for understanding the consequences of PQ in the brain. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have worldwide impact but continue to lack safe, low cost, and effective treatments. In this study, we show how the simple polyamine spermidine can relieve cancer cell defects in autophagy, which trigger oxidative stress-induced cell death and promote liver fibrosis and HCC. We found that the autophagic marker protein LC3 interacted with the microtubule-associated protein MAP1S, which positively regulated autophagy flux in cells. MAP1S stability was regulated in turn by its interaction with the histone deacetylase HDAC4. Notably, MAP1S-deficient mice exhibited a 20{\%} reduction in median survival and developed severe liver fibrosis and HCC under stress. Wild-type mice or cells treated with spermidine exhibited a relative increase in MAP1S stability and autophagy signaling via depletion of cytosolic HDAC4. Extending recent evidence that orally administered spermidine can extend lifespan in mice, we determined that life extension of up to 25{\%} can be produced by lifelong administration, which also reduced liver fibrosis and HCC foci as induced by chemical insults. Genetic investigations established that these observed impacts of oral spermidine administration relied upon MAP1S-mediated autophagy. Our findings offer a preclinical proof of concept for the administration of oral spermidine to prevent liver fibrosis and HCC and potentially extend lifespan. Cancer Res; 77(11); 2938-51.

In addition, in vitro studies have supported a loss of function of Beclin-1 due to proteolytic modification by caspases. In the present study, we examined whether caspase-cleavage of Beclin-1 occurs in the AD brain by designing a site-directed caspase-cleavage antibody based upon a known cleavage site within the protein at position D149. We confirmed that Beclin-1 is an excellent substrate for caspase-3 and demonstrates cleavage led to the formation of a 35-kDa C-terminal fragment labeled by our novel antibody following Western blot analysis. Application of this antibody termed Beclin-1 caspase-cleavage product antibody or BeclinCCP in frontal cortex tissue sections revealed strong immunolabeling within astrocytes that localized with plaque regions and along blood vessels in all AD cases examined. In addition, weaker, more variable BeclinCCP labeling was also observed within neurofibrillary tangles that colocalized with the early tau conformational marker, MC-1 as well as the late tangle marker, PHF-1. Collectively, these data support a depletion of Beclin-1 in AD following caspase-cleavage.

abstract = {Accumulation of amyloid-$\beta$ peptides (A$\beta$) within brain is a major pathogenic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests that autophagy, an important intracellular catabolic process, is involved in A$\beta$ clearance. Here, we investigated whether temsirolimus, a newly developed compound approved by Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for renal cell carcinoma treatment, would promote autophagic clearance of A$\beta$ and thus provide protective effects in cellular and animal models of AD. HEK293 cells expressing the Swedish mutant of APP695 (HEK293-APP695) were treated with vehicle or 100nM temsirolimus for 24h in the presence or absence of 3-methyladenine (5mM) or Atg5-siRNA, and intracellular A$\beta$ levels as well as autophagy biomarkers were measured. Meanwhile, APP/PS1 mice received intraperitoneal injection of temsirolimus (20mg/kg) every 2 days for 60 days, and brain A$\beta$ burden, autophagy biomarkers, cellular apoptosis in hippocampus, and spatial cognitive functions were assessed. Our results showed that temsirolimus enhanced A$\beta$ clearance in HEK293-APP695 cells and in brain of APP/PS1 mice in an autophagy-dependent manner. Meanwhile, temsirolimus attenuated cellular apoptosis in hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, which was accompanied by an improvement in spatial learning and memory abilities. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that temsirolimus promotes autophagic A$\beta$ clearance and exerts protective effects in cellular and animal models of AD, suggesting that temsirolimus administration may represent a new therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. Meanwhile, these findings emphasize the notion that many therapeutic agents possess pleiotropic actions aside from their main applications.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process that is crucial for organ homeostasis in mammals. However, methods to directly measure macroautophagic activity (or flux) in vivo are limited. In this study we developed a quantitative macroautophagic flux assay based on measuring LC3b protein turnover in vivo after administering the protease inhibitor leupeptin. Using this assay we then characterized basal macroautophagic flux in different mouse organs. We found that the rate of LC3b accumulation after leupeptin treatment was greatest in the liver and lowest in spleen. Interestingly we found that LC3a, an ATG8/LC3b homologue and the LC3b-interacting protein p62 were degraded with similar kinetics to LC3b. However, the LC3b-related proteins GABARAP and GATE-16 were not rapidly turned over in mouse liver, implying that different LC3b homologues may contribute to macroautophagy via distinct mechanisms. Nutrient starvation augmented macroautophagic flux as measured by our assay, while refeeding the animals after a period of starvation significantly suppressed flux. We also confirmed that beclin 1 heterozygous mice had reduced basal macroautophagic flux compared to wild-type littermates. These results illustrate the usefulness of our leupeptin-based assay for studying the dynamics of macroautophagy in mice.},

Lithium, which modulates GSK3beta activity, has been shown to reduce amyloid production and tau phosphorylation in pre-pathological AD mouse models. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic LiCl treatment in aged double transgenic mice (AbetaPPSwe/PS1A246E). We found that chronic lithium treatment decreased the gamma-cleavage of amyloid-beta protein precursor, further reduced amyloid-beta production and senile plaque formation, accompanied by the improvement in spatial learning and memory abilities. Because autophagy may play an important role in the pathology of AD, we also assessed the autophagy activity and found that the chronic lithium treatment attenuated the autophagy activation in this AD mouse model. Our results suggest that prolonged lithium treatment, even during the later stages of AD, could be an effective therapeutics.},

abstract = {Autophagy is implicated in the pathogenesis of major neurodegenerative disorders although concepts about how it influences these diseases are still evolving. Once proposed to be mainly an alternative cell death pathway, autophagy is now widely viewed as both a vital homeostatic mechanism in healthy cells and as an important cytoprotective response mobilized in the face of aging- and disease-related metabolic challenges. In Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and other diseases, impairment at different stages of autophagy leads to the buildup of pathogenic proteins and damaged organelles, while defeating autophagy's crucial prosurvival and antiapoptotic effects on neurons. The differences in the location of defects within the autophagy pathway and their molecular basis influence the pattern and pace of neuronal cell death in the various neurological disorders. Future therapeutic strategies for these disorders will be guided in part by understanding the manifold impact of autophagy disruption on neurodegenerative diseases.},

The role of pesticide exposure in neurodegenerative disease has long been suspected, but the specific causative agents and the mechanisms underlying are not fully understood. For the main neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis there are evidences linking their etiology with long-term/low-dose exposure to pesticides such as paraquat, maneb, dieldrin, pyrethroids and organophosphates. Most of these pesticides share common features, namely the ability to induce oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, $\alpha$-synuclein fibrillization and neuronal cell loss. This review aims to clarify the role of pesticides as environmental risk factors in genesis of idiopathic PD and other neurological syndromes. For this purpose, the most relevant epidemiological and experimental data is highlighted in order to discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration.},

The selectivity of CMA permits timed degradation of specific proteins with regulatory purposes supporting a modulatory role for CMA in enzymatic metabolic processes and subsets of the cellular transcriptional program. In addition, CMA contributes to cellular quality control through the removal of damaged or malfunctioning proteins. Here, we describe recent advances in the understanding of the molecular dynamics, regulation and physiology of CMA, and discuss the evidence in support of the contribution of CMA dysfunction to severe human disorders such as neurodegeneration and cancer.},

abstract = {Beyond their contribution to basic metabolism, the major cellular organelles, in particular mitochondria, can determine whether cells respond to stress in an adaptive or suicidal manner. Thus, mitochondria can continuously adapt their shape to changing bioenergetic demands as they are subjected to quality control by autophagy, or they can undergo a lethal permeabilization process that initiates apoptosis. Along similar lines, multiple proteins involved in metabolic circuitries, including oxidative phosphorylation and transport of metabolites across membranes, may participate in the regulated or catastrophic dismantling of organelles. Many factors that were initially characterized as cell death regulators are now known to physically or functionally interact with metabolic enzymes. Thus, several metabolic cues regulate the propensity of cells to activate self-destructive programs, in part by acting on nutrient sensors. This suggests the existence of "metabolic checkpoints" that dictate cell fate in response to metabolic fluctuations. Here, we discuss recent insights into the intersection between metabolism and cell death regulation that have major implications for the comprehension and manipulation of unwarranted cell loss.},

The formation of PQ and DQ radicals was verified optically and observed directly by ESR spectroscopy in the NADPH-PQ and -DQ reductase reactions by brain Ms under anaerobic conditions. PQ- and DQ-induced superoxide formation was confirmed by the detection of DMPO-OOH ESR signals and followed by chemiluminescence (CL) of a Cypridina luciferin analogue (CLA). The kinetics and intensity of the CL were consistent with the observations that the reduction in DQ is faster than that in PQ. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and phospholipid hydroperoxides in brain Ms increased in the presence of NADPH and Fe3+. The generation of both lipid peroxidation products derived from brain Ms decreased with increasing concentrations of PQ and DQ. The inhibitory effect of DQ is more pronounced than that of PQ. The formation of PQ- and DQ-induced reactive oxygen species was not associated with lipid peroxidation in rat brain Ms.},

abstract = {Autophagy, the major degradative pathway for organelles and long-lived proteins, is essential for the survival of neurons. Mounting evidence has implicated defective autophagy in the pathogenesis of several major neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). A continuum of abnormalities of the lysosomal system has been identified in neurons of the AD brain, including pathological endocytic pathway responses at the very earliest disease stage and a progressive disruption of autophagy leading to the massive buildup of incompletely digested substrates within dystrophic axons and dendrites. In this review, we examine research on autophagy in AD and evaluate evidence addressing the specific step or steps along the autophagy pathway that may be defective. Current evidence strongly points to disruption of substrate proteolysis within autolysosomes for the principal mechanism underlying autophagy failure in AD. In the most common form of familial early onset AD, mutant presenilin 1 disrupts autophagy directly by impeding lysosomal proteolysis while, in other forms of AD, autophagy impairments may involve different genetic or environmental factors. Attempts to restore more normal lysosomal proteolysis and autophagy efficiency in mouse models of AD pathology have yielded promising therapeutic effects on neuronal function and cognitive performance, demonstrating the relevance of autophagy failure to the pathogenesis of AD and the potential of autophagy modulation as a therapeutic strategy.

The short postmortem intervalbrain samples were processed for postmitochondrial supernatant, nonsynaptic mitochondria, and synaptosome fractions. Samples were analyzed for several antioxidants (glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, catalase) and the oxidative marker, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. The tissue was also analyzed for possible changes in protein damage using neurochemical markers for protein carbonyls, 3-nitrotyrosine, 4-hydroxynonenal, andacrolein. All 3 neuropil fractions (postmitochondrial supernatant, mitochondrial, and synaptosomal) demonstrated significant disease-dependent increases in oxidative markers. The highest changes were observed in the synaptosomal fraction. Both mitochondrial and synaptosomal fractions had significant declines in antioxidants (glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase). Levels of oxidative markers significantly correlated with Mini-Mental Status Examination scores. Oxidative stress was more localized to the synapses, with levels increasing in a disease-dependent fashion.

abstract = {Reliable and quantitative assays to measure in vivo autophagy are essential. Currently, there are varied methods for monitoring autophagy; however, it is a challenge to measure "autophagic flux" in an in vivo model system. Conversion and subsequent degradation of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1-LC3/LC3) to the autophagosome associated LC3-II isoform can be evaluated by immunoblot. However, static levels of endogenous LC3-II protein may render possible misinterpretations since LC3-II levels can increase, decrease or remain unchanged in the setting of autophagic induction. Therefore, it is necessary to measure LC3-II protein levels in the presence and absence of lysomotropic agents that block the degradation of LC3-II, a technique aptly named the "autophagometer." In order to measure autophagic flux in mouse skeletal muscle, we treated animals with the microtubule depolarizing agent colchicine. Two days of 0.4 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal colchicine blocked autophagosome maturation to autolysosomes and increased LC3-II protein levels in mouse skeletal muscle by {\textgreater}100{\%}. The addition of an autophagic stimulus such as dietary restriction or rapamycin led to an additional increase in LC3-II above that seen with colchicine alone. Moreover, this increase was not apparent in the absence of a "colchicine block." Using this assay, we evaluated the autophagic response in skeletal muscle upon denervation induced atrophy. Our studies highlight the feasibility of performing an "in vivo autophagometer" study using colchicine in skeletal muscle.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a conserved pathway that maintains cellular quality control. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) controls various aspects of cell physiology including proliferation. Multiple signalling cascades, including ERK, have been shown to regulate autophagy, however whether autophagy proteins (ATG) regulate cell signalling is unknown. Here we show that growth factor exposure increases the interaction of ERK cascade components with ATG proteins in the cytosol and nucleus. ERK and its upstream kinase MEK localize to the extra-luminal face of autophagosomes. ERK2 interacts with ATG proteins via its substrate-binding domains. Deleting Atg7 or Atg5 or blocking LC3 lipidation or ATG5-ATG12 conjugation decreases ERK phosphorylation. Conversely, increasing LC3-II availability by silencing the cysteine protease ATG4B or acute trehalose exposure increases ERK phosphorylation. Decreased ERK phosphorylation in Atg5⁻/⁻ cells does not occur from overactive phosphatases. Our findings thus reveal an unconventional function of ATG proteins as cellular scaffolds in the regulation of ERK phosphorylation.},

abstract = {Although the causes and consequences of social dominance have been examined extensively, avian studies have rarely focused on between-population differences in social dominance. On the island of Corsica, two resident blue tit Parus caeruleus populations 25 km apart differ significantly in body size measures, timing and effort of reproduction, and song structure, and some of these population differences have a genetic basis. Because earlier avian studies have shown that social dominance is influenced by body size or mass, we predicted that individuals from these two blue tit populations would also differ in their ability to dominate other individuals. Consistent with this prediction, we found that male blue tits of these two populations differ in social dominance, and that heavier or larger individuals dominate lighter or smaller ones in aviary experiments. We propose that social dominance may serve to maintain phenotypic population differentiation at a micro-geographic scale by acting as a barrier to dispersal.},

Such interventions include caloric restriction mimetics, which are defined as agents that mimic the beneficial effects of dietary restriction while limiting its detrimental effects. One such agent, the natural polyamine spermidine, has prominent cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects and stimulates anticancer immunosurveillance in rodent models. Moreover, dietary polyamine uptake correlates with reduced cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality in human epidemiological studies. Spermidine preserves mitochondrial function, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, and prevents stem cell senescence. Mechanistically, it shares the molecular pathways engaged by other caloric restriction mimetics: It induces protein deacetylation and depends on functional autophagy. Because spermidine is already present in daily human nutrition, clinical trials aiming at increasing the uptake of this polyamine appear feasible.},

Following proof-of-concept studies with stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, several new approaches such as structured illumination microscopy (SIM), photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), have been developed for imaging of nanoscale structural details and fast cellular dynamics in biological research. In this chapter, after briefly explaining their principles, we will describe the recent application of these super-resolution techniques in single cell imaging. In addition, the extension of super-resolution microscopy to 3D, multicolor, live-cell imaging and multimodal imaging are also discussed, significantly improving the precision of single cell imaging. Combining with molecular biology, biochemistry and bio-computing algorithms, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy continues to expand its capabilities and provide comprehensive insights into the details of single cells.},

Experiments in vitro have shown that RPM inhibits lymphoproliferation by mechanisms of action that are different from other immunosuppressants. Much less is known, however, about the effects of RPM on immune cells in vivo compared to other immunosuppressive drugs. Others have shown that in vivo treatment with CsA suppresses the responsiveness of cells in the mixed lymphocyte response (MLR). Therefore, to investigate the effects of RPM in vivo, rats were treated with RPM and their lymphoid cells used as responder cells in the MLR. We confirmed that the proliferation of cells in the MLR was decreased after treatment with CsA in vivo. In contrast, treatment with RPM in vivo greatly increased the proliferative response to alloantigen in the MLR. These findings show that the effects of RPM and CsA on immune cells in vivo differ. Perhaps the cells proliferating in the MLR after in vivo RPM treatment play a role in the regulation of the immune system that enables this immunosuppressant to prolong allograft survival so effectively in rodents.},

Consequently, autophagy is strictly controlled and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination have long been associated with autophagy regulation.

abstract = {Background. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) strongly protects against myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. However, IPC protection is ineffective in aged hearts. Exercise training reduces the incidence of age-related cardiovascular disease and upregulates the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)/polyamine pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate whether exercise can reestablish IPC protection in aged hearts and whether IPC protection is linked to restoration of the cardiac polyamine pool. Methods. Rats aging 3 or 18 months perform treadmill exercises with or without gradient respectively for 6 weeks. Isolated hearts and isolated cardiomyocytes were exposed to an IR and IPC protocol. Results. IPC induced an increase in myocardial polyamines by regulating ODC and spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT) in young rat hearts, but IPC did not affect polyamine metabolism in aged hearts. Exercise training inhibited the loss of preconditioning protection and restored the polyamine pool by activating ODC and inhibiting SSAT in aged hearts. An ODC inhibitor, $\alpha$-difluoromethylornithine, abolished the recovery of preconditioning protection mediated by exercise. Moreover, polyamines improved age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro. Conclusion. Exercise appears to restore preconditioning protection in aged rat hearts, possibly due to an increase in intracellular polyamines and an improvement in mitochondrial function in response to a preconditioning stimulus.},

Available evidence suggests that deficiencies in KGDHC may be genetic in some cases, whereas evidence that the other two enzyme systems have a genetic component is lacking. Additional results indicate that the reductions can also be secondary to other causes including oxidative stress.

abstract = {The mechanism of the antiproliferation effect of spermidine and spermine was studied using a cell culture system of mouse FM3A cells. The addition of either 10 mM spermidine or 2 mM spermine to the growth medium containing 0.9 mM Mg 2+ greatly inhibited cell growth (more than 90{\%}). A decrease in the Mg 2+ concentration to 50 $\mu$M in the growth medium, but without the polyamine addition, did not influence cell growth. However, the concentrations of spermidine and spermine necessary for the inhibition of cell growth when cells were cultured in the presence of 50 $\mu$M Mg 2+ were much smaller (2 mM spermidine and 0.15 mM spermine). Nevertheless, the amount of polyamines accumulating in cells which could cause the inhibition of cell growth was almost the same, regardless of the large difference in the added polyamine concentrations. At the early stage of polyamine accumulation, the inhibition of cell growth correlated with the decrease of Mg 2+ content, but not with a decrease of the ATP content. The decrease in Mg 2+ content correlated well with the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis, especially protein synthesis. Thus, the inhibition of cell growth at the early stage of polyamine accumulation was thought to be due to the inactivation of ribosomes through the replacement of Mg 2+ on magnesium‐binding sites by polyamines. The decrease in Mg 2+ content was mainly caused by the inhibition of Mg 2+ transport by polyamines. At the later stage of polyamine accumulation, a decrease in ATP content was also observed. This was followed by swelling of the mitochondria, which may be a symptom of the subsequent cell death. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {Brain atrophy caused by neuronal loss is a prominent pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (Abeta), the major component of senile plaques, is considered to play a central role in neuronal cell death. In addition to removal of the toxic Abeta, direct suppression of neuronal loss is an essential part of AD treatment; however, no such neuroprotective therapies have been developed. Excess amount of Abeta evokes multiple cytotoxic mechanisms, involving increase of the intracellular Ca(2+) level, oxidative stress, and receptor-mediated activation of cell-death cascades. Such diversity in cytotoxic mechanisms induced by Abeta clearly indicates a complex nature of the AD-related neuronal cell death. We have identified a 24-residue peptide, Humanin (HN), which suppresses in vitro neuronal cell death caused by all AD-related insults, including Abeta, so far tested. The anti-AD effect of HN has been further confirmed in vivo using mice with Abeta-induced amnesia. Altogether, such potent neuroprotective activity of HN against AD-relevant cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo suggests the potential clinical applications of HN in novel AD therapies aimed at controlling neuronal death.},

abstract = {This review surveys the literature about changes in polyamine contents and levels of activity of the enzymes involved in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway in organs of ageing mammals. The literature about changes in the polyamine levels in physiological fluids in healthy ageing humans is also reviewed. Generally speaking, decreases in the levels of the main polyamines (noticeably putrescine and spermidine) are observed in different mammalian organs with ageing. The polyamine levels in serum and in urine of healthy human beings are also age-related, declining progressively with increasing age. Some major enzymes (i.e., ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) and S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.50) involved in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway show similar trends. Hormonal induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity is strongly reduced in organs of aged animals, as it is in neoplastic organs. There is also some evidence for an age-related decrease in the level of ornithine decarboxylase and its inducibility in mammalian cells cultured in vitro. Some in vitro effects of spermidine and spermine on aged structures or systems are briefly summarized. There is no evidence yet that this generally reduced capacity of mammalian aged organs for polyamine biosynthesis is one of the factors responsible for the well known high incidence of some neoplasias in elderly humans. In view of the typical stimulatory effects of the tumour promoters on polyamine biosynthesis in target tissues and the effects of senescence on the same metabolic pathway, it can be excluded that the ageing process has a tumour promoting effect by itself. However, although the exact mechanism responsible for the increased occurrence of some tumors during mammalian senescence is still obscure, there are enough experimental data (both in humans and in animals) to indicate that the reduced polyamine biosynthetic capacity of aged mammals can account for the slower course of some tumors in elderly patients.},

The efficacy of forming new memories declines with advancing age, but the synaptic changes underlying age-induced memory impairment remain poorly under- stood. Recently, we found spermidine feeding to specifically suppress age-dependent impairments in forming olfactory memories, providing a mean to search for synaptic changes involved in age-dependent memory impairment. Here, we show that a specific synaptic compartment, the presynaptic active zone (AZ), increases the size of its ultrastruc- tural elaboration and releases significantly more synaptic vesicles with advancing age. These age-induced AZ changes, however, were fully suppressed by spermidine feeding. A genetically enforced enlargement of AZ scaffolds (four gene-copies of BRP) impaired mem- ory formation in young animals. Thus, in the Drosophila nervous system, aging AZs seem to steer towards the upper limit of their operational range, limiting synaptic plasticity and contributing to impairment of memory formation. Spermidine feeding suppresses age- dependent memory impairment by counteracting these age-dependent changes directly at the synapse.},

abstract = {The most common neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Tauopathies, which include Alzheimer disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Pick disease and cases of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, are characterized by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated and filamentous MAPT/tau protein. The pathological mechanisms involved in MAPT protein accumulation are not well understood, but a possible impairment of protein degradation pathways has been suggested. We investigated the effects of autophagy stimulation on MAPT pathology in a model tauopathy, the human mutant P301S MAPT transgenic mouse line. In the brain of the trehalose-treated mutant mice, autophagy is activated and a reduced number of neurons containing MAPT inclusions, as well as a decreased amount of insoluble MAPT, are observed. The improvement of MAPT pathology is associated with increased nerve cell survival. Moreover, MAPT inclusions colocalize with SQSTM1/p62- and LC3-positive puncta, suggesting the colocalization of MAPT aggregates with autophagic vacuoles. Autophagy is not activated in the spinal cord of the human P301S MAPT transgenic mice and neuronal survival, as well as MAPT pathology, is unaffected. This study supports a role for autophagy stimulation in the degradation of MAPT aggregates and opens new perspectives for the investigation of autophagy as a pathological mechanism involved in neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Background: Rotenone is an environmental neurotoxin that induces accumulation of $\alpha$-synuclein and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), but the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We investigated whether rotenone induced impairment of autophagic flux and lysosomal functions. Methods: Autophagy flux, accumulation of $\alpha$-synuclein, lysosomal membrane integrity and neurodegeneration were assessed in the rotenone-treated rat model and PC12 cells, and the effects of the autophagy inducer trehalose on rotenone's cytotoxicity were also studied. Results: Rotenone administration significantly reduced motor activity and caused a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase in SNpc of Lewis rats. The degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons was accompanied by the deposition of $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates, autophagosomes and redistribution of cathepsin D from lysosomes to the cytosol. In cultured PC12 cells, rotenone also induced increases in protein levels of $\alpha$-synuclein, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II, Beclin 1, and p62. Rotenone increased lysosomal membrane permeability as evidenced by leakage of N-acetyl-beta- d-glucosaminidase and cathepsin D, the effects were blocked by reactive oxygen species scavenger tiron. Autophagy inducer trehalose enhanced the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB, accelerated the clearance of autophagosomes and $\alpha$-synuclein and attenuated rotenone-induced cell death of PC12 cells. Meanwhile, administration of trehalose to rats in drinking water (2{\%}) decreased rotenone-induced dopaminergic neurons loss in SNpc. Conclusions: These studies indicate that the lysosomal dysfunction contributes to rotenone's neurotoxicity and restoration of lysosomal function could be a new therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease.},

Molecular cell biologists have been endeavoring to ascertain a roadmap for APP processing and trafficking in various cell types including neurons. This has led to the identification of numerous regulatory sorting mechanisms, protein-protein interactions and lipidic microenvironments that largely define how and where the substrate APP meets its processing enzymes. However, the cell biology of tau, and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, has long been regarded as a separate field. Nonetheless, recent progress is bringing both worlds together in a new paradigm on how A$\beta$ toxicity and tau are physiologically connected. Here, we discuss an update of our current appraisal on how membrane trafficking may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease and how this could be exploited for effective therapy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: There is an ongoing search for new drugs and drug targets to treat diseases like Alzheimer's disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Both obesity and T2D are characterized by the development of a cardiomyopathy associated with increased hypertension and compensatory left ventricular hypertrophy. Small, specific glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitors were developed to replace lithium chloride for use in psychiatric disorders. In addition, they were advocated as treatment for T2D since GSK-3 inhibition improves blood glucose handling. However, GSK-3 is a regulator of hypertrophic signalling in the heart via phosphorylation of NFATc3 and beta-catenin respectively. In view of this, we hypothesized that chronic inhibition of GSK-3 will induce myocardial hypertrophy or exacerbate existing hypertrophy. METHODS: Rats with obesity-induced prediabetes were treated orally with GSK-3 inhibitor (CHIR118637 (CT20026)), 30 mg/kg/day for the last 8 weeks of a 20-week diet high in sugar content vs a control diet. Biometric and biochemical parameters were measured, echocardiography performed and localization and co-localization of NFATc3 and GATA4 determined in cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: Obesity initiated myocardial hypertrophy, evidenced by increased ventricular mass (1.158 +/- 0.029 vs 0.983 +/- 0.03 g) and enlarged cardiomyocytes (18.86 +/- 2.25 vs 14.92 +/- 0.50um2) in association with increased end-diastolic diameter (EDD = 8.48 +/- 0.11 vs 8.15 +/- 0.10 mm). GSK-3 inhibition (i) increased ventricular mass only in controls (1.075 +/- 0.022 g) and (ii) EDD in both groups (controls: 8.63 +/- 0.07; obese: 8.72 +/- 0.15 mm) (iii) localized NFATc3 and GATA4 peri-nuclearly. CONCLUSION: Indications of onset of myocardial hypertrophy in both control and obese rats treated with a GSK-3 inhibitor were found. It remains speculation whether these changes were adaptive or maladaptive.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress can damage cellular antioxidant defense and reduce livestock production efficiency. Spermine is a ubiquitous cellular component that plays important roles in stabilizing nucleic acids, modulating cell growth and differentiation, and regulating ion channel activities. Spermine has the potential to alleviate the effects of oxidative stress. However, to date no information is available about the effect of spermine administration on antioxidant property of the liver and spleen in any mammalian in vivo system. This study aims to investigate the protective effect of spermine on rat liver and spleen under oxidative stress. Rats received intragastric administration of either 0.4 $\mu$mol/g body weight of spermine or saline once a day for 3 days. The rats in each treatment were then injected with either diquat or sterile saline at 12 mg/kg body weight. Liver and spleen samples were collected 48 h after the last spermine ingestion. Results showed that regardless of diquat treatment, spermine administration significantly reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) content by 23.78{\%} in the liver and by 5.75{\%} in the spleen, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05). Spermine administration also enhanced the catalase (CAT) activity, anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR) capacity and glutathione (GSH) content by 38.68{\%}, 15.53{\%} and 1.32{\%} in the spleen, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05). There were interactions between spermine administration and diquat injection about anti-superoxide anion (ASA), AHR capacity, CAT activity, GSH content, and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the liver and about ASA capacity and T-AOC in the spleen of weaned rats (P {\textless} 0.05). Compared with the control group, spermine administration significantly increased the AHR capacity, CAT activity, GSH content, and T-AOC by 40.23{\%}, 31.15{\%}, 30.25{\%}, 35.37{\%} in the liver, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05) and increased the T-AOC by 8{\%} in the spleen of weaned rats (P {\textless} 0.05). Compared with the diquat group, spermine + diquat group significantly increased ASA capacity by 15.63{\%} in the liver and by 73.41{\%} in the spleen of weaned rats, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05). Results demonstrate that spermine administration can increase the antioxidant capacity in the liver and spleen and can enhance the antioxidant status in the spleen and liver under oxidative stress.},

abstract = {Two major risk factors for late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD), a leading cause of dementia worldwide, are increasing age and inheritance of the $\epsilon$4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4). Several isoform-specific effects of apoE have been proposed; however, the mechanisms by which apoE isoforms influence the pathogenesis of AD are unknown. Also associated with AD is increased lipid peroxidation in the regions of the brain most damaged by disease. 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), the most potent neurotoxic product of lipid peroxidation, is thought to be deleterious to cells through reactions with protein nucleophiles. We tested the hypothesis that accumulation of the most common forms of HNE-protein adducts, borohydride-reducible adducts, is associated with AD and examined whether there was a relationship to APOE. Our results demonstrated that reducible HNE adducts were increased in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and temporal cortex of patients with AD. Furthermore, our data showed that the pattern of reducible HNE adduct accumulation was related to APOE genotype; AD patients homozygous for APOE4 had pyramidal neuron cytoplasmic accumulation of reducible HNE adducts, while AD APOE3 homozygotes had both pyramidal neuron and astrocyte accumulation of reducible lINE adducts. This is in contrast to our previous observations that a distinct HNE protein adduct, the pyrrole adduct, accumulates on neurofibrillary tangles in AD patients. We conclude that APOE genotype influences the cellular distribution of increased reducible HNE adduct accumulation in AD.},

abstract = {One histological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease is the tangle. The other is the plaque. A widely discussed hypothesis is the "amyloid cascade" assuming that tangle formation is a direct consequence of amyloid plaque formation. The aim of this study was to examine plaques and tangles in a highly defined neuronal circuitry in order to determine their detailed spatial and temporal relationships. We investigated serial sections of the whole hippocampal formation of brains with early Braak-stages (0-III) for tangles only, i.e. one case at stage 0, six at stage I, six at stage II, and nine at stage III. Most cases displayed both plaques and tangles. Four cases of stages 0 and I, three cases with stage II, and even one with stage III, however, did not display plaques. In turn, no plaque was found in the absence of tangles. The spatial relationship indicates that plaques lay in the terminal fields of tangle-bearing neurons. Our analysis suggests that tangles either antecede plaques or - less likely - are independently formed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The mitochondrial kinase PINK1 and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin are participating in quality control after CCCP- or ROS-induced mitochondrial damage, and their dysfunction is associated with the development and progression of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, PINK1 expression is also induced by starvation indicating an additional role for PINK1 in stress response. Therefore, the effects of PINK1 deficiency on the autophago-lysosomal pathway during stress were investigated. Under trophic deprivation SH-SY5Y cells with stable PINK1 knockdown showed downregulation of key autophagic genes, including Beclin, LC3 and LAMP-2. In good agreement, protein levels of LC3-II and LAMP-2 but not of LAMP-1 were reduced in different cell model systems with PINK1 knockdown or knockout after addition of different stressors. This downregulation of autophagic factors caused increased apoptosis, which could be rescued by overexpression of LC3 or PINK1. Taken together, the PINK1-mediated reduction of autophagic key factors during stress resulted in increased cell death, thus defining an additional pathway that could contribute to the progression of Parkinson's disease in patients with PINK1 mutations.},

abstract = {Autophagosomes have been reported to form in the vicinity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In many cases, the phagophore membrane is observed between two cisternae of rough ER, but it is not known whether these two membranes are directly connected. To investigate the relationship of the phagophore membrane and the ER, we used electron microscopic tomography of serum and amino acid starved normal rat kidney cells. The cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde and reduced osmium tetroxide and embedded in Epon. Dual axis tilt image series were acquired from two successive 250-nm sections. To analyze the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of phagophores and the associated rough ER, 3D tomograms were used to model the ER and phagophore membranes. The tomographic reconstructions revealed connections between the phagophore/autophagosome membrane and the closely located ER cisternae, especially with the ER located inside the autophagosome. The connections were typically formed by narrow extensions from the phagophore/autophagosome to the ER. This finding has potential implications on the origin of autophagosome membranes, and on the mechanism of phagophore membrane extension. In addition, we observed lipid droplets in very close contact with the phagophores/autophagosomes.},

Rapamycin, a lipophilic, macrolide antibiotic, induces autophagy by inactivating the protein mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). We previously showed that rapamycin protects against mutant huntingtin-induced neurodegeneration in cell, fly and mouse models of Huntington's disease [Ravikumar, B., Duden, R. and Rubinsztein, D.C. (2002) Aggregate-prone proteins with polyglutamine and polyalanine expansions are degraded by autophagy. Hum. Mol.

(2004) Inhibition of mTOR induces autophagy and reduces toxicity of polyglutamine expansions in fly and mouse models of Huntington disease. Nat. Genet., 36, 585-595]. This protective effect of rapamycin was attributed to enhanced clearance of the mutant protein via autophagy [Ravikumar, B., Duden, R. and Rubinsztein, D.C.

Here, we show that rapamycin may have additional cytoprotective effects--it protects cells against a range of subsequent pro-apoptotic insults and reduces paraquat toxicity in Drosophila. This protection can be accounted for by enhanced clearance of mitochondria by autophagy, thereby reducing cytosolic cytochrome c release and downstream caspase activation after pro-apoptotic insults. Thus, rapamycin (pro-autophagic) treatment may be useful in certain disease conditions (including various neurodegenerative diseases) where a slow but increased rate of apoptosis is evident, even if they are not associated with overt aggregate formation.},

Here we show that interaction of CypD with mitochondrial amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) potentiates mitochondrial, neuronal and synaptic stress. The CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Abeta- and Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling and permeability transition. Additionally, they have an increased calcium buffering capacity and generate fewer mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the absence of CypD protects neurons from Abeta- and oxidative stress-induced cell death. Notably, CypD deficiency substantially improves learning and memory and synaptic function in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and alleviates Abeta-mediated reduction of long-term potentiation. Thus, the CypD-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition pore is directly linked to the cellular and synaptic perturbations observed in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Blockade of CypD may be a therapeutic strategy in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have worldwide impact but continue to lack safe, low cost, and effective treatments. In this study, we show how the simple polyamine spermidine can relieve cancer cell defects in autophagy, which trigger oxidative stress-induced cell death and promote liver fibrosis and HCC. We found that the autophagic marker protein LC3 interacted with the microtubule-associated protein MAP1S, which positively regulated autophagy flux in cells. MAP1S stability was regulated in turn by its interaction with the histone deacetylase HDAC4. Notably, MAP1S-deficient mice exhibited a 20{\%} reduction in median survival and developed severe liver fibrosis and HCC under stress. Wild-type mice or cells treated with spermidine exhibited a relative increase in MAP1S stability and autophagy signaling via depletion of cytosolic HDAC4. Extending recent evidence that orally administered spermidine can extend lifespan in mice, we determined that life extension of up to 25{\%} can be produced by lifelong administration, which also reduced liver fibrosis and HCC foci as induced by chemical insults. Genetic investigations established that these observed impacts of oral spermidine administration relied upon MAP1S-mediated autophagy. Our findings offer a preclinical proof of concept for the administration of oral spermidine to prevent liver fibrosis and HCC and potentially extend lifespan.

Mutations in the PINK1 gene result in an autosomal recessive form of early-onset PD. PINK1 plays a vital role in mitochondrial quality control via the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. The aim of the present study was to create a cellular model of PD using siRNA-mediated knock down of PINK1 in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells The possible protective effects of curcumin, known for its many beneficial properties including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, was tested on this model in the presence and absence of paraquat, an additional stressor. PINK1 siRNA and control cells were separated into four treatment groups: (i) untreated, (ii) treated with paraquat, (iii) pre-treated with curcumin then treated with paraquat, or (iv) treated with curcumin. Various parameters of cellular and mitochondrial function were then measured. The PINK1 siRNA cells exhibited significantly decreased cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, and increased apoptosis. Paraquat-treated cells exhibited decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, a more fragmented mitochondrial network and decreased MMP. Curcumin pre-treatment followed by paraquat exposure rescued cell viability and increased MMP and mitochondrial respiration in control cells, and significantly decreased apoptosis and increased MMP and maximal respiration in PINK1 siRNA cells. These results highlight a protective effect of curcumin against mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in PINK1-deficient and paraquat-exposed cells. More studies are warranted to further elucidate the potential neuroprotective properties of curcumin.},

abstract = {Age is the main risk factor for a number of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which increasing numbers of elderly individuals suffer. These pathological conditions are characterized by progressive loss of neuron cells, compromised motor or cognitive functions, and accumulation of abnormally aggregated proteins. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the main features of the aging process, particularly in organs requiring a high-energy source such as the heart, muscles, brain, or liver. Neurons rely almost exclusively on the mitochondria, which produce the energy required for most of the cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter synthesis. The brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and damage, because of its high oxygen consumption, low antioxidant defenses, and high content of polyunsaturated fats very prone to be oxidized. Thus, it is not surprising the importance of protecting systems, including antioxidant defenses, to maintain neuronal integrity and survival. Here, we review the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in the aging process, with a specific focus on neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involving mitochondria and oxidative stress in the aging and neurodegeneration may help to identify new strategies for improving the health and extending lifespan.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder thought to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Loss of function mutations in the putative mitochondrial protein PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1) have been linked to familial forms of PD, but the relation of PINK1 to mammalian mitochondrial function remains unclear. Here, we report that germline deletion of the PINK1 gene in mice significantly impairs mitochondrial functions. Quantitative electron microscopic studies of the striatum in PINK1(-/-) mice at 3-4 and 24 months revealed no gross changes in the ultrastructure or the total number of mitochondria, although the number of larger mitochondria is selectively increased. Functional assays showed impaired mitochondrial respiration in the striatum but not in the cerebral cortex at 3-4 months of age, suggesting specificity of this defect for dopaminergic circuitry. Aconitase activity associated with the Krebs cycle is also reduced in the striatum of PINK1(-/-) mice. Interestingly, mitochondrial respiration activities in the cerebral cortex are decreased in PINK1(-/-) mice at 2 years compared with control mice, indicating that aging can exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction in these mice. Furthermore, mitochondrial respiration defects can be induced in the cerebral cortex of PINK1(-/-) mice by cellular stress, such as exposure to H(2)O(2) or mild heat shock. Together, our findings demonstrate that mammalian PINK1 is important for mitochondrial function and provides critical protection against both intrinsic and environmental stress, suggesting a pathogenic mechanism by which loss of PINK1 may lead to nigrostriatal degeneration in PD.},

Alterations in macroautophagy, the vacuolar catabolism of cytoplasmic constituents, have been described in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we utilized retinoic-acid differentiated SH-SY5Y cells to determine whether autophagy contributes to mutant LRRK2-associated neurite degeneration. Transfection of pre-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells with LRRK2 cDNA containing the common G2019S mutation resulted in significant decreases in neurite length, which were not observed in cells transfected with wild type LRRK2 or its kinase-dead K1906M mutation. G2019S LRRK2 transfected cells also exhibited striking increases in autophagic vacuoles in both neuritic and somatic compartments, as demonstrated by fluorescence and western blot analysis of the autophagy marker green fluorescent protein-tagged microtubule-associated protein Light Chain 3 and by transmission electron microscopy. RNA interference knockdown of LC3 or Atg7, two essential components of the conserved autophagy machinery, reversed the effects of G2019S LRRK2 expression on neuronal process length, whereas rapamycin potentiated these effects. The mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene (U0126) reduced LRRK2-induced neuritic autophagy and neurite shortening, implicating MAPK/ERK-related signaling.

abstract = {Impaired autophagic machinery is implicated in a number of diseases such as heart disease, neurodegeneration and cancer. A common denominator in these pathologies is a dysregulation of autophagy that has been linked to a change in susceptibility to cell death. Although we have progressed in understanding the molecular machinery and regulation of the autophagic pathway, many unanswered questions remain. How does the metabolic contribution of autophagy connect with the cell's history and how does its current autophagic flux affect metabolic status and susceptibility to undergo cell death? How does autophagic flux operate to switch metabolic direction and what are the underlying mechanisms in metabolite and energetic sensing, metabolite substrate provision and metabolic integration during the cellular stress response? In this article we focus on unresolved questions that address issues around the role of autophagy in sensing the energetic environment and its role in actively generating metabolite substrates. We attempt to provide answers by explaining how and when a change in autophagic pathway activity such as primary stress response is able to affect cell viability and when not. By addressing the dynamic metabolic relationship between autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis we provide a new perspective on the parameters that connect autophagic activity, severity of injury and cellular history in a logical manner. Last, by evaluating the cell's condition and autophagic activity in a clear context of regulatory parameters in the intra- and extracellular environment, this review provides new concepts that set autophagy into an energetic feedback loop, that may assist in our understanding of autophagy in maintaining healthy cells or when it controls the threshold between cell death and cell survival.},

abstract = {Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in neuronal injury associated with various neuropathological disorders. However, little is known regarding the relationship between antioxidant enzyme capacity and resultant toxicity. The antioxidant pathways of primary cerebrocortical cultures were directly examined using a novel technique that measures pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity, which is enzymatically coupled to glutathione peroxidase (GPx) detoxification of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). PPP activity was quantified from data obtained by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of released labeled lactate following metabolic degradation of [1,6-(13)C2, 6,6-(2)H2] glucose by cerebrocortical cultures. The antioxidant capacity of these cultures was systematically evaluated using H2O2, and the resultant toxicity was quantified by lactate dehydrogenase release. Exposure of primary mixed and purified astrocytic cultures to H2O2 caused stimulation of PPP activity in a concentration-dependent fashion from 0.25 to 22.2{\%} and from 6.9 to 66.7{\%} of glucose metabolized to lactate through the PPP, respectively. In the mixed cultures, chelation of iron before H2O2 exposure was protective and resulted in a correlation between PPP saturation and toxicity. Conversely, addition of iron, inhibition of GPx, or depletion of glutathione decreased H2O2-induced PPP stimulation and increased toxicity. These results implicate the Fenton reaction, reflect the pivotal role of GPx in H2O2 detoxification, and contribute to our understanding of the etiological role of free radicals in neuropathological conditions.},

In addition, the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters were measured in the striatum using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After MPTP exposure, all groups manifested decreased rolling bar latency and spontaneous activity, in addition to increased pole-climbing time. The combined treatment group exhibited a recovery of rolling bar latency and pole-climbing time. The number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra following MPTP treatment was higher in the combined treatment group compared with the positive control group (p = .003). Immunoreactivity for LC3 was higher in the combined treatment group than in the controls (p = .003). The concentrations of both striatal dopamine and the dopamine metabolite dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC) were decreased in both MPTP-treated groups compared with the controls. The loss of DOPAC was less severe in the combined treatment group relative to the positive control group (p = .001). Therefore, we infer that valproate combined with lithium carbonate can rescue dopaminergic neurons and ameliorate the loss of DOPAC following MPTP treatment, likely via activation of autophagic/lysosomal pathways.},

abstract = {Cryo-soft X-ray tomography (cryo-SXT) is a powerful imaging technique that can extract ultrastructural information from whole, unstained mammalian cells as close to the living state as possible. Subcellular organelles including the nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria have been identified by morphology alone, due to the similarity in contrast to transmission electron micrographs. In this study, we used cryo-SXT to image endosomes and autophagosomes, organelles that are particularly susceptible to chemical fixation artefacts during sample preparation for electron microscopy. We used two approaches to identify these compartments. For early and recycling endosomes, which are accessible to externally-loaded markers, we used an anti-transferrin receptor antibody conjugated to 10. nm gold particles. For autophagosomes, which are not accessible to externally-applied markers, we developed a correlative cryo-fluorescence and cryo-SXT workflow (cryo-CLXM) to localise GFP-LC3 and RFP-Atg9. We used a stand-alone cryo-fluorescence stage in the home laboratory to localise the cloned fluorophores, followed by cryo-soft X-ray tomography at the synchrotron to analyse cellular ultrastructure. We mapped the 3D ultrastructure of the endocytic and autophagic structures, and discovered clusters of omegasomes arising from 'hotspots' on the ER. Thus, immunogold markers and cryo-CLXM can be used to analyse cellular processes that are inaccessible using other imaging modalities. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

In many organisms, the primary role of autophagy is adaptation to starvation. However, we have found that autophagy is also important for intracellular protein quality control. Atg5(-/-) mice die shortly after birth due, at least in part, to nutrient deficiency. These mice also exhibit an intracellular accumulation of protein aggregates in neurons and hepatocytes. We now report the generation of neural cell-specific Atg5-deficient mice. Atg5( flox/flox);Nestin-Cre mice show progressive deficits in motor function and degeneration of some neural cells. In autophagy-deficient cells, diffuse accumulation of abnormal proteins occurs, followed by the generation of aggregates and inclusions. This study emphasizes the point that basal autophagy is important even in individuals who do not express neurodegenerative disease-associated mutant proteins. Furthermore, the primary targets of autophagy are diffuse cytosolic proteins, not protein aggregates themselves.},

abstract = {Starvation-induced autophagosomes engulf cytosol and/or organelles and deliver them to lysosomes for degradation, thereby resupplying depleted nutrients. Despite advances in understanding the molecular basis of this process, the membrane origin of autophagosomes remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that, in starved cells, the outer membrane of mitochondria participates in autophagosome biogenesis. The early autophagosomal marker, Atg5, transiently localizes to punctae on mitochondria, followed by the late autophagosomal marker, LC3. The tail-anchor of an outer mitochondrial membrane protein also labels autophagosomes and is sufficient to deliver another outer mitochondrial membrane protein, Fis1, to autophagosomes. The fluorescent lipid NBD-PS (converted to NBD-phosphotidylethanolamine in mitochondria) transfers from mitochondria to autophagosomes. Photobleaching reveals membranes of mitochondria and autophagosomes are transiently shared. Disruption of mitochondria/ER connections by mitofusin2 depletion dramatically impairs starvation-induced autophagy. Mitochondria thus play a central role in starvation-induced autophagy, contributing membrane to autophagosomes.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent cellular catabolic mechanism that mediates the turnover of intracellular organelles and long-lived proteins. Reduced autophagic activity has been shown to lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in neurons and might be involved in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we uncover an essential role for the syntaxin-5 SNARE complex in autophagy. Using genetic knockdown, we show that the syntaxin-5 SNARE complex regulates the later stages of autophagy after the initial formation of autophagosomes. This SNARE complex acts on autophagy by regulating ER-to-Golgi transport through the secretory pathway, which is essential for the activity of lysosomal proteases such as cathepsins. Depletion of syntaxin-5 complex components results in the accumulation of autophagosomes as a result of lysosomal dysfunction, leading to decreased degradation of autophagic substrates. Our findings provide a novel link between a fundamental process such as intracellular trafficking and human diseases that might be affected by defective biogenesis and/or homeostasis of the autophagosome-lysosome degradation system.},

abstract = {Literature reviews are in great demand in most scientific fields. Their need stems from the ever-increasing output of scientific publications [1]. For example, compared to 1991, in 2008 three, eight, and forty times more papers were indexed in Web of Science on malaria, obesity, and biodiversity, respectively [2]. Given such mountains of papers, scientists cannot be expected to examine in detail every single new paper relevant to their interests [3]. Thus, it is both advantageous and necessary to rely on regular summaries of the recent literature. Although recognition for scientists mainly comes from primary research, timely literature reviews can lead to new synthetic insights and are often widely read [4]. For such summaries to be useful, however, they need to be compiled in a professional way [5]. When starting from scratch, reviewing the literature can require a titanic amount of work. That is why researchers who have spent their career working on a certain research issue are in a perfect position to review that literature. Some graduate schools are now offering courses in reviewing the literature, given that most research students start their project by producing an overview of what has already been done on their research issue [6]. However, it is likely that most scientists have not thought in detail about how to approach and carry out a literature review. Reviewing the literature requires the ability to juggle multiple tasks, from finding and evaluating relevant material to synthesising information from various sources, from critical thinking to paraphrasing, evaluating, and citation skills [7]. In this contribution, I share ten simple rules I learned working on about 25 literature reviews as a PhD and postdoctoral student. Ideas and insights also come from discussions with coauthors and colleagues, as well as feedback from reviewers and editors.},

Although the role of autophagy dysfunction in AD is known, the dynamic changes during the progression of the disease remain unclear. Recent studies have provided new insight into the molecular mechanisms that link defective autophagy and cellular fate, underscoring the pathogenic events associated with AD. Here, we will focus on recent studies that underpin a distinct role for autophagy deficits and highly localized autophagic defects, impacting primarily the amyloidogenic pathway activity. By uniquely assessing the dynamic changes in key proteins during the disease progression in the context of the autophagy machinery function and amyloid beta toxicity, specifically, a connect between protein degradation failure and cell death susceptibility is revealed which may suggest new avenues for the development of better targeted therapeutic interventions.},

The senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) was a non-genetically modified mice widely used as a rodent model of aging and senile dementia. However, little was known about the age-related changes of autophagy in the brain of SAMP8 mice. To better understand the precise relationship between aging, autophagy and neurodegeneration, we explored the time course of cognitive ability, ubiquitin-positive inclusions, ultrastructure of neurons and detected the expression of LC3 and Beclin 1 protein in different brain regions of 2, 7 and 12-month-old SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice. We found that 7 and 12-month-old SAMP8 mice presented cognitive decline and ubiquitinated proteins enhanced. In the hippocampal neurons of 12-month-old SAMP8 mice, lots of dense clumps and autophagic vacuoles were found in the cytoplasm and axons. The LC3-II expression showed an increase in hippocampus and cortex of 7 and 12-month-old SAMP8 mice. The expression of Beclin 1 displayed a significant increase in 7months old and a decline in 12months old mice. Based on these data, we suggest that the autophagic activity maybe increase reactively at the beginning of AD and then showed a decline with aging, and the pathological changes of 12-month-old SAMP8 mice are more similar to the late-onset AD in the perspective of autophagy.},

Mitochondrial proton leak was the least sensitive to energy supply. Control analysis was used to quantify the relative control over ATP production exerted by the individual groups of ATP-consuming reactions. Control was widely shared; no block of reactions had more than one-third of the control. A fuller control analysis showed that there appeared to be a hierarchy of control over the flux through ATP: protein synthesis {\textgreater} RNA/DNA synthesis and substrate oxidation {\textgreater} Na+ cycling and Ca2+ cycling {\textgreater} other ATP consumers and mitochondrial proton leak. Control analysis also indicated that there was significant control over the rates of individual ATP consumers by energy supply. Each ATP consumer had strong control over its own rate but very little control over the rates of the other ATP consumers.},

We recently showed that presenilin-1 and -2, the catalytic components of $\gamma$-secretase, and $\gamma$-secretase activity itself, are highly enriched in a subcompartment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is physically and biochemically connected to mitochondria, called mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). We now show that MAM function and ER-mitochondrial communication-as measured by cholesteryl ester and phospholipid synthesis, respectively-are increased significantly in presenilin-mutant cells and in fibroblasts from patients with both the familial and sporadic forms of AD. We also show that MAM is an intracellular detergent-resistant lipid raft (LR)-like domain, consistent with the known presence of presenilins and $\gamma$-secretase activity in rafts. These findings may help explain not only the aberrant APP processing but also a number of other biochemical features of AD, including altered lipid metabolism and calcium homeostasis. We propose that upregulated MAM function at the ER-mitochondrial interface, and increased cross-talk between these two organelles, may play a hitherto unrecognized role in the pathogenesis of AD.},

abstract = {Progressive cerebral deposition of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is believed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The highly amyloidogenic 42-residue form of Abeta (Abeta42) is the first species to be deposited in both sporadic and familial AD. Mutations in two familial AD-linked genes, presenilins 1 (PS1) and 2 (PS2), selectively increase the production of Abeta42 in cultured cells and the brains of transgenic mice, and gene deletion of PS1 shows that it is required for normal gamma-secretase cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate Abeta. To establish the subcellular localization of the PS1 regulation of APP processing to Abeta, fibroblasts from PS1 wild-type (wt) or knockout (KO) embryos as well as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with wt or mutant PS1 were subjected to subcellular fractionation on discontinuous Iodixanol gradients. APP C-terminal fragments (CTF) were markedly increased in both endoplasmic reticulum- (ER-) and Golgi-rich fractions of fibroblasts from KO mice; moreover, similar increases were documented directly in KO brain tissue. No change in the subcellular distribution of full-length APP was detectable in fibroblasts lacking PS1. In CHO cells, a small portion of APP, principally the N-glycosylated isoform, formed complexes with PS1 in both ER- and Golgi-rich fractions, as detected by coimmunoprecipitation. When the same fractions were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for Abetatotal and Abeta42, Abeta42 was the major Abeta species in the ER fraction (Abeta42:Abetatotal ratio 0.5-1.0), whereas absolute levels of both Abeta42 and Abeta40 were higher in the Golgi fraction and the Abeta42:Abetatoal ratio was 0.05-0.16 there. Mutant PS1 significantly increased Abeta42 levels in the Golgi fraction. Our results indicate PS1 and APP can interact in the ER and Golgi, where PS1 is required for proper gamma-secretase processing of APP CTFs, and that PS1 mutations augment Abeta42 levels principally in Golgi-like vesicles.},

abstract = {Amyloidogenic proteins undergo an alternative folding pathway under stressful conditions leading to formation of fibrils having cross ??-sheet structure, which is the hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. As a means of surviving against external stress, on the other hand, many microorganisms accumulate small stress molecules to prevent abnormal protein folding and to contribute to protein stability, which hints at the efficacy of the solutes against amyloid formation. The current work demonstrates the effectiveness of small stress molecules such as ectoine, betaine, trehalose, and citrulline on inhibition of insulin amyloid formation in vitro. The inhibitory effects were analyzed by thioflavin T-induced fluorescence, circular dichroism, and atomic force microscopy. This report suggests that naturally occurring small molecules may serve a function that is typically fulfilled by protein chaperones, and it provides a hint for designing inhibitors against amyloid formation associated with neurodegenerative disorders. ?? 2004 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

abstract = {The human brain consumes 20{\%} of the total basal oxygen (O2) budget to support ATP intensive neuronal activity. Without sufficient O2 to support ATP demands, neuronal activity fails, such that, even transient ischemia is neurodegenerative. While the essentiality of O2 to brain function is clear, how oxidative stress causes neurodegeneration is ambiguous. Ambiguity exists because many of the reasons why the brain is susceptible to oxidative stress remain obscure. Many are erroneously understood as the deleterious result of adventitious O2 derived free radical and non-radical species generation. To understand how many reasons underpin oxidative stress, one must first re-cast free radical and non-radical species in a positive light because their deliberate generation enables the brain to achieve critical functions (e.g. synaptic plasticity) through redox signalling (i.e. positive functionality). Using free radicals and non-radical derivatives to signal sensitises the brain to oxidative stress when redox signalling goes awry (i.e. negative functionality). To advance mechanistic understanding, we rationalise 13 reasons why the brain is susceptible to oxidative stress. Key reasons include inter alia unsaturated lipid enrichment, mitochondria, calcium, glutamate, modest antioxidant defence, redox active transition metals and neurotransmitter auto-oxidation. We review RNA oxidation as an underappreciated cause of oxidative stress. The complex interplay between each reason dictates neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress in a dynamic context and neural identity dependent manner. Our discourse sets the stage for investigators to interrogate the biochemical basis of oxidative stress in the brain in health and disease.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy is a key pathway for the clearance of aggregate-prone cytosolic proteins. Currently, the only suitable pharmacologic strategy for up-regulating autophagy in mammalian cells is to use rapamycin, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a negative regulator of autophagy. Here we describe a novel mTOR-independent pathway that regulates autophagy. We show that lithium induces autophagy, and thereby, enhances the clearance of autophagy substrates, like mutant huntingtin and alpha-synucleins. This effect is not mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibition. The autophagy-enhancing properties of lithium were mediated by inhibition of inositol monophosphatase and led to free inositol depletion. This, in turn, decreased myo-inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) levels. Our data suggest that the autophagy effect is mediated at the level of (or downstream of) lowered IP3, because it was abrogated by pharmacologic treatments that increased IP3. This novel pharmacologic strategy for autophagy induction is independent of mTOR, and may help treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, like Huntington's disease, where the toxic protein is an autophagy substrate.},

abstract = {Background: We have previously reported the prevalence of dementia in older adults living in the rural Hai district of Tanzania according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria. The aim of this study was to compare prevalence rates using the DSM-IV criteria with those obtained using the 10/66 diagnostic criteria, which is specifically designed for use in low-and middle-income countries. Methods: In phase I, 1,198 people aged 70 and older were screened for dementia. A stratified sample of 296 was then clinically assessed for dementia according to the DSM-IV criteria. In addition, data were collected according to the protocol of the 10/66 Dementia Research Group, which allowed a separate diagnosis of dementia according to these criteria to be established. Results: The age-standardised prevalence of clinical DSM-IV dementia was 6.4{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 4.9{\'{A}}7.9{\%}) and of '10/66 dementia' was 21.6{\%} (95{\%} CI 17.5{\'{A}}25.7{\%}). Education was a significant predictor of '10/66 dementia', but not of DSM-IV dementia. Conclusions: There are large discrepancies in dementia prevalence rates depending on which diagnostic system is used. In rural sub-Saharan Africa, it is not clear whether the association between education and dementia using the 10/66 criteria is a genuine effect or the result of an educational bias within the diagnostic instrument. Despite its possible flaws, the DSM-IV criteria represent an international standard for dementia diagnosis. The 10/66 diagnostic criteria may be more appropriate when identification of early and mild cognitive impairment is required.},

abstract = {Peroxynitrite is thought to be a nitric oxide-derived neurotoxic effector molecule involved in the disruption of key energy-related metabolic targets. To assess the consequences of such interference in cellular glucose metabolism and viability, we studied the possible modulatory role played by peroxynitrite in glucose oxidation in neurons and astrocytes in primary culture. Here, we report that peroxynitrite triggered rapid stimulation of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity and the accumulation of NADPH, an essential cofactor for glutathione regeneration. In contrast to peroxynitrite, nitric oxide elicited NADPH depletion, glutathione oxidation, and apoptotic cell death in neurons, but not in astrocytes. These events were noticeably counteracted by pretreatment of neurons with peroxynitrite. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism responsible for this PPP stimulation and neuroprotection, we found evidence consistent with both exogenous and endogenous peroxynitrite-mediated activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), an enzyme that catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in the PPP. Moreover, functional overexpression of the G6PD gene in stably transformed PC12 cells induced NADPH accumulation and offered remarkable resistance against nitric oxide-mediated apoptosis, whereas G6PD gene-targeted antisense inhibition depleted NADPH levels and exacerbated cellular vulnerability. In light of these results, we suggest that G6PD activation represents a novel role for peroxynitrite in neuroprotection against nitric oxide-mediated apoptosis.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, neurodegenerative disease characterized by the impairment of cognitive function in elderly individuals. In a recent global gene expression study of APP transgenic mice, we found elevated expression of mitochondrial genes, which we hypothesize represents a compensatory response because of mitochondrial oxidative damage caused by the over-expression of mutant APP and/or amyloid beta (Abeta). We investigated this hypothesis in a series of experiments examining what forms of APP and Abeta localize to the mitochondria, and whether the presence of these species is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage. Using immunoblotting, digitonin fractionation, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy techniques, we found a relationship between mutant APP derivatives and mitochondria in brain slices from Tg2576 mice and in mouse neuroblastoma cells expressing mutant human APP. Further, to determine the functional relationship between mutant APP/Abeta and oxidative damage, we quantified Abeta levels, hydrogen peroxide production, cytochrome oxidase activity and carbonyl proteins in Tg2576 mice and age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. Hydrogen peroxide levels were found to be significantly increased in Tg2576 mice when compared with age-matched WT littermates and directly correlated with levels of soluble Abeta in Tg2576 mice, suggesting that soluble Abeta may be responsible for the production of hydrogen peroxide in AD progression in Tg2576 mice. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was found to be decreased in Tg2576 mice when compared with age-matched WT littermates, suggesting that mutant APP and soluble Abeta impair mitochondrial metabolism in AD development and progression. An increase in hydrogen peroxide and a decrease in cytochrome oxidase activity were found in young Tg2576 mice, prior to the appearance of Abeta plaques. These findings suggest that early mitochondrially targeted therapeutic interventions may be effective in delaying AD progression in elderly individuals and in treating AD patients.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a degradative mechanism involved in the recycling and turnover of cytoplasmic constituents from eukaryotic cells. This phenomenon of autophagy has been observed in neurons from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting a functional role for autophagy in neuronal cell death. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that exposure to pesticides can be a risk factor in the incidence of PD. In this sense, paraquat (PQ) (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride), a widely used herbicide that is structurally similar to the known dopaminergic neurotoxicant MPP(+) (1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridine), has been suggested as a potential etiologic factor for the development of PD. The current study shows, for the first time, that low concentrations of PQ induce several characteristics of autophagy in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In this way, PQ induced the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in the cytoplasm and the recruitment of a LC3-GFP fusion protein to AVs. Furthermore, the cells treated with PQ showed an increase of the long-lived protein degradation which is blocked in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Finally, the cells succumbed to cell death with hallmarks of apoptosis such as phosphatidylserine exposure, caspase activation, and chromatin condensation. While caspase inhibition retarded cell death, autophagy inhibition accelerated the apoptotic cell death induced by PQ. Altogether, these findings show the relationship between autophagy and apoptotic cell death in human neuroblastoma cells treated with PQ.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a constitutive lysosomal catabolic pathway that degrades damaged organelles and protein aggregates. In Parkinson's disease, the synaptic protein alpha-synuclein (AS) accumulates in neuronal cell bodies and axons. Recent studies indicate that aggregation-prone proteins can spread to other brain cells - such as glia - contributing to progressive deterioration. Although autophagic dysfunction and protein aggregation have been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, exact mechanisms are not clear and most work was done in neurons and not on microglial cells. Here we report that AS fibrils but not monomers induce lysosomal damage and autophagy in microglial cells and we extensively characterized the dynamics of this response by both live-cell imaging and correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM). In addition, we found that autophagy inhibition in these cells impairs mitochondrial quality and leads to microglial cell death. We propose that AS accumulation in lysosomes leads to lysosomal damage, which in turn activates canonical autophagy as a rescue mechanism. Our results provide novel findings about the interaction between AS and the autophagy pathway in microglial cells, which may be important for targeting protein misfolding-associated neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {We recently identified physical exercise as a newly defined inducer of autophagy in vivo. Exercise induced autophagy in multiple organs involved in metabolic regulation, such as muscle, liver, pancreas and adipose tissue. To study the physiological role of exercise-induced autophagy, we generated mice with a knock-in nonphosphorylatable mutation in BCL2 (Thr69Ala, Ser70Ala and Ser84Ala) (BCL2 AAA) that are defective in exercise- and starvation-induced autophagy but not in basal autophagy. We found that BCL2 AAA mice could not run on a treadmill as long as wild-type mice, and did not undergo exercise-mediated increases in skeletal glucose muscle uptake. Unlike wild-type mice, the BCL2 AAA mice failed to reverse high-fat diet-induced glucose intolerance after 8 weeks of exercise training, possibly due to defects in signaling pathways that regulate muscle glucose uptake and metabolism during exercise. Together, these findings suggested a hitherto unknown important role of autophagy in mediating exercise-induced metabolic benefits. In the present addendum, we show that treadmill exercise also induces autophagy in the cerebral cortex of adult mice. This observation raises the intriguing question of whether autophagy may in part mediate the beneficial effects of exercise in neurodegeneration, adult neurogenesis and improved cognitive function.},

Little is known, however, about the pathways by which wild-type alpha-synuclein is normally degraded. We found that wild-type alpha-synuclein was selectively translocated into lysosomes for degradation by the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway. The pathogenic A53T and A30P alpha-synuclein mutants bound to the receptor for this pathway on the lysosomal membrane, but appeared to act as uptake blockers, inhibiting both their own degradation and that of other substrates. These findings may underlie the toxic gain-of-function by the mutants.},

abstract = {SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) is a multifunctional signaling molecule, involved in a variety of cellular pathways. SQSTM1 is one of the best-known autophagic substrates, and is therefore widely used as an indicator of autophagic degradation. Here we report that the expression level of SQSTM1 can be restored during prolonged starvation. Upon starvation, SQSTM1 is initially degraded by autophagy. However, SQSTM1 is restored back to basal levels during prolonged starvation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HepG2 cells, but not in HeLa and HEK293 cells. Restoration of SQSTM1 depends on its transcriptional upregulation, which is triggered by amino acid starvation. Furthermore, amino acids derived from the autophagy-lysosome pathway are used for de novo synthesis of SQSTM1 under starvation conditions. The restoration of SQSTM1 is independent of reactivation of MTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1). These results suggest that the expression level of SQSTM1 in starved cells is determined by at least 3 factors: autophagic degradation, transcriptional upregulation, and availability of lysosomal-derived amino acids. The results of this study also indicate that the expression level of SQSTM1 does not always inversely correlate with autophagic activity.},

abstract = {Damage to mitochondria can lead to the depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby sensitizing impaired mitochondria for selective elimination by autophagy. However, fusion of uncoupled mitochondria with polarized mitochondria can compensate for damage, reverse membrane depolarization, and obviate mitophagy. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is mutated in monogenic forms of Parkinson's disease, was recently found to induce selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria. Here we show that ubiquitination of mitofusins Mfn1 and Mfn2, large GTPases that mediate mitochondrial fusion, is induced by Parkin upon membrane depolarization and leads to their degradation in a proteasome- and p97-dependent manner. p97, a AAA+ ATPase, accumulates on mitochondria upon uncoupling of Parkin-expressing cells, and both p97 and proteasome activity are required for Parkin-mediated mitophagy. After mitochondrial fission upon depolarization, Parkin prevents or delays refusion of mitochondria, likely by the elimination of mitofusins. Inhibition of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission, the proteasome, or p97 prevents Parkin-induced mitophagy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND 100 years after the first description, Alzheimer's disease is one of the most disabling and burdensome health conditions worldwide. We used the Delphi consensus method to determine dementia prevalence for each world region. METHODS 12 international experts were provided with a systematic review of published studies on dementia and were asked to provide prevalence estimates for every WHO world region, for men and women combined, in 5-year age bands from 60 to 84 years, and for those aged 85 years and older. UN population estimates and projections were used to estimate numbers of people with dementia in 2001, 2020, and 2040. We estimated incidence rates from prevalence, remission, and mortality. FINDINGS Evidence from well-planned, representative epidemiological surveys is scarce in many regions. We estimate that 24.3 million people have dementia today, with 4.6 million new cases of dementia every year (one new case every 7 seconds). The number of people affected will double every 20 years to 81.1 million by 2040. Most people with dementia live in developing countries (60{\%} in 2001, rising to 71{\%} by 2040). Rates of increase are not uniform; numbers in developed countries are forecast to increase by 100{\%} between 2001 and 2040, but by more than 300{\%} in India, China, and their south Asian and western Pacific neighbours.

abstract = {Autophagy is an intracellular bulk degradation system that is found ubiquitously in eukaryotes. Autophagy is responsible for the degradation of most long-lived proteins and some organelles. Cytoplasmic constituents, including organelles, are sequestered into double-membraned autophagosomes, which subsequently fuse with lysosomes where their contents are degraded. This system has been implicated in various physiological processes including protein and organelle turnover, the starvation response, cellular differentiation, cell death, and pathogenesis. However, methods for monitoring autophagy have been very limited and unsatisfactory. The most standard method is conventional electron microscopy. In addition, some biochemical methods have been utilized to measure autophagic activity. Recently, the molecular basis of autophagosome formation has been extensively studied using yeast cells; these studies have provided useful marker proteins for autophagosomes. Importantly, most of these proteins are conserved in mammals. Using these probes, we can now specifically monitor autophagic activity. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Electron tomography has significantly contributed to recent findings regarding the biogenesis of the phagophore, an organelle which initiates autophagic sequestration. The information obtained from 1.9 nm slices through the tomograms have revealed that during biogenesis the phagophore is in contact with the membranes of apposing organelles to form tubular connections and membrane contact sites (MCSs). The most reported and established tubular connections occur between the phagophore and the endoplasmic reticulum. However, as the phagophore continues to grow and expand, connections and MCSs have also been reported to occur between the phagophore and several other organelles in a possible attempt to utilize lipids for membrane expansion from alternative sources. Since the lifespan of the phagophore is only a few minutes and membrane connections and MCSs are very dynamic, capturing these two events requires precision during fixation. Up to date there is no quicker alternative for sample preservation in transmission electron microscopy than cryoimmobilization. In this report, we describe our protocol for cryoimmobilization using high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution, and report our first findings on phagophore morphology using this approach.},

abstract = {Trehalose, a disaccharide present in many non-mammalian species, protects cells against various environmental stresses. Whereas some of the protective effects may be explained by its chemical chaperone properties, its actions are largely unknown. Here we report a novel function of trehalose as an mTOR-independent autophagy activator. Trehalose-induced autophagy enhanced the clearance of autophagy substrates like mutant huntingtin and the A30P and A53T mutants of alpha-synuclein, associated with Huntington disease (HD) and Parkinson disease (PD), respectively. Furthermore, trehalose and mTOR inhibition by rapamycin together exerted an additive effect on the clearance of these aggregate-prone proteins because of increased autophagic activity. By inducing autophagy, we showed that trehalose also protects cells against subsequent pro-apoptotic insults via the mitochondrial pathway. The dual protective properties of trehalose (as an inducer of autophagy and chemical chaperone) and the combinatorial strategy with rapamycin may be relevant to the treatment of HD and related diseases, where the mutant proteins are autophagy substrates.},

These lipid raft-like regions of ER are referred to as mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), and they play an important role in, for example, lipid synthesis, calcium homeostasis, and apoptotic signaling. Perturbation of MAM function has previously been suggested in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as shown in fibroblasts from AD patients and a neuroblastoma cell line containing familial presenilin-2 AD mutation. The effect of AD pathogenesis on the ER-mitochondria interplay in the brain has so far remained unknown. Here, we studied ER-mitochondria contacts in human AD brain and related AD mouse and neuronal cell models. We found uniform distribution of MAM in neurons. Phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein-2 and $\sigma$1 receptor, two MAM-associated proteins, were shown to be essential for neuronal survival, because siRNA knockdown resulted in degeneration. Up-regulated MAM-associated proteins were found in the AD brain and amyloid precursor protein (APP)Swe/Lon mouse model, in which up-regulation was observed before the appearance of plaques. By studying an ER-mitochondria bridging complex, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor-voltage-dependent anion channel, we revealed that nanomolar concentrations of amyloid $\beta$-peptide increased inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and voltage-dependent anion channel protein expression and elevated the number of ER-mitochondria contact points and mitochondrial calcium concentrations. Our data suggest an important role of ER-mitochondria contacts and cross-talk in AD pathology.},

abstract = {Neurodegenerative dementia comprises chronic and progressive illnesses with major clinical features represented by progressive and permanent loss of cognitive and mental performance, including impairment of memory and brain functions. Many different forms of neurodegenerative dementia exist, but they are all characterized by death of specific subpopulation of neurons and accumulation of proteins in the brain. We incorporated data from OMIM and primary molecular targets of drugs in the different phases of the drug discovery process to try to reveal possible hidden mechanism in neurodegenerative dementia. In the present study, a systems biology approach was used to investigate the molecular connections among seemingly distinct complex diseases with the shared clinical symptoms of dementia that could suggest related disease mechanisms. Network analysis was applied to characterize an interaction network of disease proteins and drug targets, revealing a major role of metabolism and, predominantly, of autophagy process in dementia and, particularly, in tauopathies. Different phases of the autophagy molecular pathway appear to be implicated in the individual disease pathophysiology and specific drug targets associated to autophagy modulation could be considered for pharmacological intervention. In particular, in view of their centrality and of the direct association to autophagy proteins in the network, PP2A subunits could be suggested as a suitable molecular target for the development of novel drugs. The present systems biology investigation identifies the autophagy pathway as a central dis-regulated process in neurodegenerative dementia with a prevalent involvement in diseases characterized by tau inclusion and indicates the disease-specific molecules in the pathway that could be considered for therapy.},

However, using growth factor-dependent cells from Bax/Bak-deficient mice, we demonstrate that apoptosis is not essential to limit cell autonomous survival. Following growth factor withdrawal, Bax -/- Bak -/- cells activate autophagy, undergo progressive atrophy, and ultimately succumb to death. These effects result from loss of the ability to take up sufficient nutrients to maintain cellular bioenergetics. Despite abundant extracellular nutrients, growth factor-deprived cells maintain ATP production from catabolism of intracellular substrates through autophagy. Autophagy is essential for maintaining cell survival following growth factor withdrawal and can sustain viability for several weeks. During this time, cells respond to growth factor readdition by rapid restoration of the ability to take up and metabolize glucose and by subsequent recovery of their original size and proliferative potential. Thus, growth factor signal transduction is required to direct the utilization of sufficient exogenous nutrients to maintain cell viability.},

abstract = {$\beta$-Amyloid is one of the most significant features of Alzheimer's disease, and has been considered to play a pivotal role in neurodegeneration through an unknown mechanism. However, it has been noted that $\beta$-amyloid accumulation is associated with markers of oxidative stress including protein oxidation (Smith et al., 1997), lipid peroxidation (Mark et al., 1997; Sayre et al., 1997), advanced glycation end products (Smith et al., 1994), and oxidation of nucleic acids (Nunomura et al., 1999). Furthermore, studies from cultured cells have shown that $\beta$-amyloid leads to an increase in hydrogen peroxide levels (Behl et al., 1994), and the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (Harris et al., 1995). Taken together, this evidence supports the idea that $\beta$-amyloid plays a key role in oxidative stress-evoked neuropathology. In this study, we examined the induction of oxidative stress in response to amyloid load in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The mice carrying mutant amyloid precursor protein and presenilins-1 (Goate et al., 1991; Hardy, 1997), develops $\beta$-amyloid deposits at 10-12 weeks of age and show several features of the human disease (Holcomb et al., 1998; Matsuoka et al., 2001; McGowan et al., 1999; Takeuchi et al., 2000; Wong et al., 1999). Both 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (protein and lipid oxidative stress markers, respectively) associate strongly with fibrillar $\beta$-amyloid, but not with diffuse (thioflavine S negative) $\beta$-amyloid, and the levels increase in relation to the age-associated increase in fibrillar amyloid load. From these data we suggest that fibrillar $\beta$-amyloid is associated with oxidative damage which may influence disease progression in the Alzheimer's disease brain. {\textcopyright} 2001 IBRO.},

abstract = {Recent etiological study in twins (Tanner et al. 1999) strongly suggests that environmental factors play an important role in typical, non-familial Parkinson's disease (PD), beginning after age 50. Epidemiological risk factor analyses of typical PD cases have identified several neurotoxicants, including MPP(+) (the active metabolite of MPTP), paraquat, dieldrin, manganese and salsolinol. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these neurotoxic agents might induce cell death in our nigral dopaminergic cell line, SN4741 (Son et al. 1999) through a common molecular mechanism. Our initial experiments revealed that treatment with both MPP(+) and the other PD-related neurotoxicants induced apoptotic cell death in SN4741 cells, following initial increases of H(2)O(2)-related ROS activity and subsequent activation of JNK1/2 MAP kinases. Moreover, we have demonstrated that during dopaminergic cell death cascades, MPP(+), the neurotoxicants and an oxidant, H(2)O(2) equally induce the ROS-dependent events. Remarkably, the oxidant treatment alone induced similar sequential molecular events: ROS increase, activation of JNK MAP kinases, activation of the PITSLRE kinase, p110, by both Caspase-1 and Caspase-3-like activities and apoptotic cell death. Pharmacological intervention using the combination of the antioxidant Trolox and a pan-caspase inhibitor Boc-(Asp)-fmk (BAF) exerted significant neuroprotection against ROS-induced dopaminergic cell death. Finally, the high throughput cDNA microarray screening using the current model identified downstream response genes, such as heme oxygenase-1, a constituent of Lewy bodies, that can be the useful biomarkers to monitor the pathological conditions of dopaminergic neurons under neurotoxic insult.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress occurs in a variety of disease settings and is strongly linked to the development of neuron death and neuronal dysfunction. Cells are equipped with numerous pathways to prevent the genesis, as well as the consequences, of oxidative stress in the brain. In this review we discuss the various forms and sources of oxidative stress in the brain and briefly discuss some of the complexities in detecting the presence of oxidative stress. We then focus the review on the interplay between the diverse cellular proteolytic pathways and their roles in regulating oxidative stress in the brain. Additionally, we discuss the involvement of protein synthesis in regulating the downstream effects of oxidative stress. Together, these components of the review demonstrate that the removal of damaged proteins by effective proteolysis and the synthesis of new and protective proteins are vital in the preservation of brain homeostasis during periods of increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Last, studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that protein synthesis is intricately linked to the rates of protein degradation, with impairment of protein degradation sufficient to decrease the rates of protein synthesis, which has important implications for successfully responding to periods of oxidative stress. Specific neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and stroke, are discussed in this context. Taken together, these findings add to our understanding of how oxidative stress is effectively managed in the healthy brain and help elucidate how impairments in proteolysis and/or protein synthesis contribute to the development of neurodegeneration and neuronal dysfunction in a variety of clinical settings. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A key event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is the conversion of the peptide beta-amyloid (A??) from its soluble monomeric form into various aggregated morphologies in the brain. Preventing aggregation of A?? is being actively pursued as a primary therapeutic strategy for treating AD. Trehalose, a simple disaccharide, has been shown to be effective in preventing the deactivation of numerous proteins and in protecting cells against stress. Here, we show that trehalose is also effective in inhibiting aggregation of A?? and reducing its cytotoxicity, although it shows differential effects toward A??40 and A??42. When co-incubated with A??40, trehalose inhibits formation of both fibrillar and oligomeric morphologies as determined by fluorescence staining and atomic force microscopy (AFM). However, when co-incubated with A??42, trehalose inhibits formation only of the fibrillar morphology, with significant oligomeric formation still present. When aggregated mixtures were incubated with SH-SY5Y cells, trehalose was shown to reduce the toxicity of A??40 mixtures, but not A??42. These results provide additional evidence that aggregation of A?? into soluble oligomeric forms is a pathological step in AD and that A??42 in particular is more susceptible to forming these toxic oligomers than A??40. These results also suggest that the use of trehalose, a highly soluble, low-priced sugar, as part of a potential therapeutic cocktail to control A?? peptide aggregation and toxicity warrants further study. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Alterations in CMA have recently been shown to underlie some severe human disorders for which the decline with age in the activity of this pathway might become a major aggravating factor.

In this work, we expand spermidine's range of age-related beneficial effects by demonstrating that it is also able to improve locomotor performance in aged flies. Spermidine's mechanism of action on aging has been primarily related to general protein hypoacetylation that subsequently induces autophagy. Here, we suggest that the molecular targets of spermidine also include lipid metabolism: Spermidine-fed flies contain more triglycerides and show altered fatty acid and phospholipid profiles. We further determine that most of these metabolic changes are regulated through autophagy. Collectively, our data suggests an additional and novel lipid-mediated mechanism of action for spermidine-induced autophagy.},

abstract = {Autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis have previously been described as distinct static processes that induce and execute cell death. Due to an increased use of novel techniques in mapping cellular death-techniques which allow for reporting of real-time data-the existence of "grey zones" between cell death modes and the existence of the "point of no return" within these have been revealed. This revelation demands the integration of new concepts in describing the cellular death process. Furthermore, since the contribution of autophagy in cell death or cell survival is still poorly understood, it is important to accurately describe its function within the dynamic framework of cell death. In this review cell death is viewed as a dynamic and integrative cellular response to ensure the highest likelihood of self-preservation. Suggestions are offered for conceptualizing cell death modes and their morphological features, both individually and in relation to one another. It addresses the need for distinguishing between dying cells and dead cells so as to better locate and control the onset of cell death. Most importantly, the fundamental role of autophagy, autophagic flux, and the effects of the intracellular metabolic environment on the kinetics of the cell death modes are stressed. It also contextualizes the kinetic dimension of cell death as a process and aims to contribute towards a better understanding of autophagy as a key mechanism within this process. Understanding the dynamic nature of the cell death process and autophagy's central role can reveal new insight for therapeutic intervention in preventing cell death.},

abstract = {Preventing or reducing tau hyperphosphorylation is considered to be a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rapamycin may be a potential therapeutic agent for AD, because the rapamycin-induced autophagy may enhance the clearance of the hyperphosphorylated tau. However, recent rodent studies show that the protective effect of rapamycin may not be limited in the autophagic clearance of the hyperphosphorylated tau. Because some tau-related kinases are targets of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), we assume that rapamycin may regulate tau phosphorylation by regulating these kinases. Our results showed that in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, treatment with rapamycin induced phosphorylation of the type II$\alpha$ regulatory (RII$\alpha$) subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA). Rapamycin also induced nuclear translocation of the catalytic subunits (Cat) of PKA and decreases in tau phosphorylation at Ser214 (pS214). The above effects of rapamycin were prevented by pretreatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor U0126. In addition, these effects of rapamycin might not depend on the level of tau expression, because similar results were obtained in both the non-tau-expressing wild type human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and HEK293 cells stably transfected with the longest isoform of recombinant human tau (tau441; HEK293/tau441). These findings suggest that rapamycin decreases pS214 via regulation of PKA. Because tau phosphorylation at Ser214 may prime tau for further phosphorylation by other kinases, our findings provide a novel possible mechanism by which rapamycin reduces or prevents tau hyperphosphorylation.},

abstract = {Little is known about the association between autophagy and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Also unknown are possible distinguishing features of cardiac autophagy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In hearts from streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice, diastolic function was impaired, though autophagic activity was significantly increased, as evidenced by increases in microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3/LC3 and LC3-II/-I ratios, SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) and CTSD (cathepsin D), and by the abundance of autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes detected electron-microscopically. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was activated and ATP content was reduced in type 1 diabetic hearts. Treatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, worsened cardiac performance in type 1 diabetes. In addition, hearts from db/db type 2 diabetic model mice exhibited poorer diastolic function than control hearts from db/+ mice. However, levels of LC3-II, SQSTM1 and phosphorylated MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) were increased, but CTSD was decreased and very few lysosomes were detected ultrastructurally, despite the abundance of autophagic vacuoles. AMPK activity was suppressed and ATP content was reduced in type 2 diabetic hearts. These findings suggest the autophagic process is suppressed at the final digestion step in type 2 diabetic hearts. Resveratrol, an autophagy enhancer, mitigated diastolic dysfunction, while chloroquine had the opposite effects in type 2 diabetic hearts. Autophagy in the heart is enhanced in type 1 diabetes, but is suppressed in type 2 diabetes. This difference provides important insight into the pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is essential for the development of new treatment strategies.},

Under basal conditions, autophagosomes are continuously generated in the axon tip. There is an ordered assembly of proteins recruited with stereotypical kinetics onto the developing autophagosome. Plasma- or mitochondrial-derived membranes were not incorporated into nascent autophagosomes in the distal axon. Rather, autophagosomes are generated at double FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1)-positive subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), distinct from ER exit sites. Biogenesis events are enriched distally; autophagosomes form infrequently in dendrites, the soma, or midaxon, consistent with a compartmentalized pathway for constitutive autophagy in primary neurons. Distal biogenesis may facilitate degradation of damaged mitochondria and long-lived cytoplasmic proteins reaching the axon tip via slow axonal transport.},

Autophagy is known to be inhibited by TOR signaling, but the mechanisms of autophagy regulation and its role in TOR-mediated cell growth are unclear. Here, we show that signaling through TOR and its upstream regulators PI3K and Rheb is necessary and sufficient to suppress starvation-induced autophagy in the Drosophila fat body. In contrast, TOR's downstream effector S6K promotes rather than suppresses autophagy, suggesting S6K downregulation may limit autophagy during extended starvation. Despite the catabolic potential of autophagy, disruption of conserved components of the autophagic machinery, including ATG1 and ATG5, does not restore growth to TOR mutant cells. Instead, inhibition of autophagy enhances TOR mutant phenotypes, including reduced cell size, growth rate, and survival. Thus, in cells lacking TOR, autophagy plays a protective role that is dominant over its potential role as a growth suppressor.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial electron transport generates the ATP that is essential for the excitability and survival of neurons, and the protein phosphorylation reactions that mediate synaptic signaling and related long-term changes in neuronal structure and function. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that divide, fuse, and move purposefully within axons and dendrites. Major functions of mitochondria in neurons include the regulation of Ca2+ and redox signaling, developmental and synaptic plasticity, and the arbitration of cell survival and death. The importance of mitochondria in neurons is evident in the neurological phenotypes in rare diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial genes. Mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress, perturbed Ca2+ homeostasis, and apoptosis may also contribute to the pathogenesis of prominent neurological diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases; stroke; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and psychiatric disorders. Advances in understanding the molecular and cell biology of mitochondria are leading to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Mammalian cells were observed to die under conditions in which nutrients were depleted and, simulta- neously, macroautophagy was inhibited either genetically (by a small interfering RNA targeting Atg5, Atg6/ Beclin 1-1, Atg10,or Atg12) or pharmacologically (by 3-methyladenine, hydroxychloroquine, bafilomycin A1, or monensin). Cell death occurred through apoptosis (type 1 cell death), since it was reduced by stabilization of mitochondrial membranes (with Bcl-2 or vMIA, a cytomegalovirus-derived gene) or by caspase inhibition. Under conditions in which the fusion between lysosomes and autophagosomes was inhibited, the formation of autophagic vacuoles was enhanced at a preapoptotic stage, as indicated by accumulation of LC3-II protein, ultrastructural studies, and an increase in the acidic vacuolar compartment. Cells exhibiting a morphology reminiscent of (autophagic) type 2 cell death, however, recovered, and only cells with a disrupted mito- chondrial transmembrane potential were beyond the point of no return and inexorably died even under optimal culture conditions. All together, these data indicate that autophagy may be cytoprotective, at least under conditions of nutrient depletion, and point to an important cross talk between type 1 and type 2 cell death pathways.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the presence of cytoplasmic and nuclear protein aggregates that result in toxicity and neuronal cell death. Autophagy is a physiological cellular process that engulfs primarily long-lived proteins as well as protein aggregates with subsequent cargo delivery for lysosomal degradation. The rate at which the material is degraded through autophagy is referred to as autophagic flux. Although we have progressed substantially in unravelling the role and regulation of the autophagy machinery, its dysfunction in pathology as well as its dynamic changes in the disease progression remains largely unclear. Furthermore, the magnitude of autophagic flux in neuronal subtypes is largely unknown and it is unclear to what extent the flux may be affected in distinct neurodegenerative disease states. In this review, we provide an introduction to autophagy in neuronal homeostasis and indicate how autophagy is currently measured and modulated for therapeutic purposes. We highlight the need not only to develop enhanced methodologies that target and assess autophagic flux precisely, but also to discern the dynamics of autophagy in different neuronal types and brain regions associated with the disease-specific pathology. Finally, we describe how existing and novel techniques for assessing autophagic flux could be implemented in order to distinguish between molecular defects associated with autophagic cargo and the machinery. In doing so, this review may provide novel insights in the assessment and control of autophagic flux that is aligned with the protein clearance dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {In rat hepatocytes, autophagy is known to be inhibited by amino acids. Insulin and cell swelling promote inhibition by amino acids. Each of the conditions leading to inhibition of autophagic proteolysis was found to be associated with phosphorylation of a 31-kDa protein that we identified as ribosomal protein S6. A combination of leucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, which efficiently inhibits autophagic proteolysis, was particularly effective in stimulating S6 phosphorylation. The relationship between the percentage inhibition of proteolysis and the degree of S6 phosphorylation was linear. Thus, inhibition of autophagy and phosphorylation of S6 are under the control of the same signal transduction pathway. Stimulation of S6 phosphorylation by the presence of amino acids was due to activation of S6 kinase and not to inhibition of S6 phosphatase. The inhibition by amino acids of both autophagic proteolysis and autophagic sequestration of electro-injected cytosolic [14C]sucrose was partially prevented by rapamycin, a compound known to inhibit activation of p70 S6 kinase. In addition, rapamycin partially inhibited the rate of protein synthesis. We conclude that the fluxes through the autophagic and protein synthetic pathways are regulated in an opposite manner by the degree to which S6 is phosphorylated. Possible mechanisms by which S6 phosphorylation can cause inhibition of autophagy are discussed.},

abstract = {The recent demonstration of K+channel dysfunction in fibroblasts from Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and past observations of Ca2+-mediated K+channel modulation during memory storage suggested that AD, which is characterized by memory loss and other cognitive deficits, might also involve dysfunction of intracellular Ca2+mobilization. Bombesin-induced Ca2+release, which is inositol trisphosphate-mediated, is shown here to be greatly enhanced in AD fibroblasts compared with fibroblasts from control groups. Bradykinin, another activator of phospholipase C, elicits similar enhancement of Ca2+signaling in AD fibroblasts. By contrast, thapsigargin, an agent that releases Ca2+by direct action on the endoplasmic reticulum, produced no differences in Ca2+increase between AD and control fibroblasts. Depolarization-induced Ca2+influx data previously demonstrated the absence of between-group differences of Ca2+pumping and/or buffering. There was no correlation between the number of passages in tissue culture and the observed Ca2+responses. Furthermore, cells of all groups were seeded and analyzed at the same densities. Radioligand binding experiments indicated that the number and affinity of bombesin receptors cannot explain the observed differences. These and previous observations suggest that the differences in bombesin and bradykinin responses in fibroblasts and perhaps other cell types are likely to be due to alteration of inositol trisphosphate-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+.},

We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures.},

abstract = {Paraquat is a herbicide with a potential risk to induce parkinsonism due to its demonstrated neurotoxicity and its strong structural similarity to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), a well-known neurotoxin which causes a clinical syndrome similar to Parkinson's disease (PD). However, at present very little is known about the signaling pathways activated by paraquat in any cell system. In this study, we have investigated the effect of paraquat on extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and protein kinase B (PKB) activation in E18 cells. Low concentrations of paraquat stimulated very early increases in ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and PKB phosphorylation. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002 (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) inhibited early paraquat-induced increases in PKB phosphorylation. Furthermore, early paraquat-mediated increases in ERK1/2 activation were sensitive to the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor PD 98059 (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone), whereas JNK1/2 responses were blocked by the JNK1/2 inhibitor SP 600125 (anthra[1-9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one). Pretreatment with wortmannin, LY 294002, or PD 98059 had no effect on paraquat cell death in E18 cells. In contrast, SP 600125 significantly decreased paraquat-induced cell death in E18 cells. In conclusion, we have shown that low concentrations of paraquat stimulate robust very early increases in ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and PKB phosphorylation in E18 cells. Furthermore, the data presented clearly suggest that inhibition of the JNK1/2 pathway protects E18 cells from paraquat-induced cell death and support the fact that inhibition of early activation of JNK1/2 can constitute a potential strategy in PD treatment.},

Here, we show that PINK1 mutants exhibit indirect flight muscle and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration accompanied by locomotive defects. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy analysis and a rescue experiment with Drosophila Bcl-2 demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction accounts for the degenerative changes in all phenotypes of PINK1 mutants. Notably, we also found that PINK1 mutants share marked phenotypic similarities with parkin mutants. Transgenic expression of Parkin markedly ameliorated all PINK1 loss-of-function phenotypes, but not vice versa, suggesting that Parkin functions downstream of PINK1. Taken together, our genetic evidence clearly establishes that Parkin and PINK1 act in a common pathway in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function in both muscles and dopaminergic neurons.},

Evidence is presented here to show that ROS are in fact important signaling molecules involved in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Moreover, evidence that the NADPH oxidase complex is a key regulator of ROS generation in synaptic plasticity and memory formation is discussed. Understanding redox signaling in the brain, including the sources and molecular targets of ROS, are important for a full understanding of the signaling pathways that underlie synaptic plasticity and memory. Knowledge of ROS function in the brain also is critical for understanding aging and neurodegenerative diseases of the brain given that several of these disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson disease, may be exacerbated by the unregulated generation of ROS. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

Autophagy, which can protect against cell death, is negatively regulated by TOR, and disruption of autophagy by mutation of Atg5 or Atg7 can lead to neurodegeneration. However, the implied functional connection between TOR signaling, autophagy, and cell death or degeneration has not been rigorously tested. Using the Drosophila melanogaster visual system, we show in this study that hyperactivation of TOR leads to photoreceptor cell death in an age- and light-dependent manner and that this is because of TOR's ability to suppress autophagy. We also find that genetically inhibiting TOR or inducing autophagy suppresses cell death in Drosophila models of Huntington's disease and phospholipase C (norpA)-mediated retinal degeneration. Thus, our data indicate that TOR induces cell death by suppressing autophagy and provide direct genetic evidence that autophagy alleviates cell death in several common types of neurodegenerative disease.},

Necrosis is commonly used but it is not appropriate, because it does not indicate a form of cell death but refers to changes secondary to cell death by any mechanism, including apoptosis. Abundant data are available on one form of accidental cell death, namely ischemic cell death, which can be considered an entity of its own, caused by failure of the ionic pumps of the plasma membrane. Because ischemic cell death (in known models) is accompanied by swelling, the name oncosis is proposed for this condition. The term oncosis (derived from {\'{o}}nkos, meaning swelling) was proposed in 1910 by von Reckling-hausen precisely to mean cell death with swelling. Oncosis leads to necrosis with karyolysis and stands in contrast to apoptosis, which leads to necrosis with karyorhexis and cell shrinkage.},

abstract = {Introduction: Nutritional intervention with the natural polyamine spermidine, an autophagy-enhancing agent, can prevent memory loss in aging model organisms. This is the first human study to evaluate the impact of spermidine supplementation on memory performance in older adults at risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Cognitively intact participants with subjective cognitive decline (n = 30, 60–80 years of age) were included in this three-months, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase IIa pilot trial with a spermidine-rich plant extract supplement. Effects of intervention were assessed using the behavioral mnemonic similarity task, measured at baseline and post-intervention visits. Data analysis was focused on reporting and interpreting effectiveness based on effect sizes. Results: Memory performance was moderately enhanced in the spermidine group compared with placebo at the end of intervention [contrast mean =.17, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): −.01,.35, Cohen's d =.77, 95{\%} CI: 0, 1.53]. Mnemonic discrimination ability improved in the spermidine-treated group with a medium effect size (mean difference = −.11, 95{\%} CI: −.19, −.03, Cohen's d =.79, 95{\%} CI:.01, 1.55). A similar effect was not found in the placebo-treated group (mean difference =.07, 95{\%} CI: −.13,.27, Cohen's d = −.20, 95{\%} CI: −.94,.54). Discussion: In this pilot trial, nutritional spermidine was associated with a positive impact on memory performance in older adults with subject cognitive decline. The beneficial effect might be mediated by stimulation of neuromodulatory actions in the memory system. A follow-up Phase IIb randomized controlled trial will help validate the therapeutic potential of spermidine supplementation and delineate possible neurophysiological mechanisms of action.

abstract = {It is puzzling that hydrogen-rich fatty acids are used only poorly as fuel in the brain. The long-standing belief that a slow passage of fatty acids across the blood-brain barrier might be the reason. However, this has been corrected by experimental results. Otherwise, accumulated nonesterified fatty acids or their activated derivatives could exert detrimental activities on mitochondria, which might trigger the mitochondrial route of apoptosis. Here, we draw attention to three particular problems: (1) ATP generation linked to $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids demands more oxygen than glucose, thereby enhancing the risk for neurons to become hypoxic; (2) $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids generates superoxide, which, taken together with the poor anti-oxidative defense in neurons, causes severe oxidative stress; (3) the rate of ATP generation based on adipose tissue-derived fatty acids is slower than that using blood glucose as fuel. Thus, in periods of extended continuous and rapid neuronal firing, fatty acid oxidation cannot guarantee rapid ATP generation in neurons. We conjecture that the disadvantages connected with using fatty acids as fuel have created evolutionary pressure on lowering the expression of the $\beta$-oxidation enzyme equipment in brain mitochondria to avoid extensive fatty acid oxidation and to favor glucose oxidation in brain. {\textcopyright} 2013 ISCBFM All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Apoptosis is a fundamental biologic process by which metazoan cells orchestrate their own self-demise. Genetic analyses of the nematode C elegans identified three core components of the suicide apparatus which include CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9. An analogous set of core constituents exists in mammalian cells and includes caspase-9, Apaf-1, and bcl-2/xL, respectively. CED-3 and CED-4, along with their mammalian counterparts, function to kill cells, whereas CED-9 and its mammalian equivalents protect cells from death. These central components biochemically intermingle in a ternary complex recently dubbed the "apoptosome." The C elegans protein EGL-1 and its mammalian counterparts, pro-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family, induce cell death by disrupting apoptosome interactions. Thus, EGL-1 may represent a primordial signal integrator for the apoptosome. Various biochemical processes including oligomerization, adenosine triphosphate ATP/dATP binding, and cytochrome c interaction play a role in regulating the ternary death complex. Recent studies suggest that cell death receptors, such as CD95, may amplify their suicide signal by activating the apoptosome. These mutual associations by core components of the suicide apparatus provide a molecular framework in which diverse death signals likely interface. Understanding the apoptosome and its cellular connections will facilitate the design of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer and other disease states in which apoptosis plays a pivotal role.},

However, the fundamental cellular mechanisms that underlie these impairments are still poorly understood, effectively hampering the development of pharmacological strategies to treat the condition. Polyamines are among the substances found to decrease with age in the human brain. We found that levels of polyamines (spermidine, putrescine) decreased in aging fruit flies, concomitant with declining memory abilities. Simple spermidine feeding not only restored juvenile polyamine levels, but also suppressed age-induced memory impairment. Ornithine decarboxylase-1, the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo polyamine synthesis, also protected olfactory memories in aged flies when expressed specifically in Kenyon cells, which are crucial for olfactory memory formation. Spermidine-fed flies showed enhanced autophagy (a form of cellular self-digestion), and genetic deficits in the autophagic machinery prevented spermidine-mediated rescue of memory impairments. Our findings indicate that autophagy is critical for suppression of memory impairments by spermidine and that polyamines, which are endogenously present, are candidates for pharmacological intervention.},

abstract = {Spermidine, a natural polyamine presented widely in mammalian cells, has been implicated to extend the lifespan of several model organisms by inducing autophagy. However, the effect of spermidine against neuronal damage has not yet been fully determined. In this study, neuronal cell injury was induced by treating PC12 cells and cortical neurons with 1 $\mu$M staurosporine (STS). We found that STS-induced cell injury could be efficiently attenuated by pretreatment with 1 mM spermidine. Spermidine inhibited the caspase 3 activation induced by STS. Moreover, STS incubation resulted in autophagic degradation failure, which could be attenuated by the pretreatment of spermidine. Knocking down the expression of Beclin 1 efficiently suppressed autophagosome and autolysosome accumulation, and abolished the protective effects of spermidine against STS-induced neurotoxicity. Increased Beclin 1 cleavage and partial nuclear translocation of Beclin 1 fragment was detected in STS-treated cells, which could be blocked by spermidine, pan-caspase inhibitor or caspase 3-specific inhibitor. The nuclear translocation of Beclin 1 fragment universally occurs in damaged neurons. Beclin 1 mutation at the sites of 146 and 149 prevented the intracellular re-distribution of Beclin 1 induced by STS. In addition, intraperitoneal injection of spermidine ameliorated ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal injury in the hippocampus and cortex of rats, possibly via blocking caspase 3 activation and consequent Beclin 1 cleavage. Our findings suggest that caspase 3-mediated Beclin 1 cleavage occurs in acute neuronal cell injury both in vitro and in vivo. The neuroprotective effect of spermidine may be related to inhibition of the caspase 3-mediated Beclin 1 cleavage and restoration of the Beclin 1-dependent autophagy.},

A misunderstanding appears to exist regarding the appropriate method for allometric dose translations, especially when starting new animal or clinical studies. The need for education regarding appropriate translation is evident from the media response regarding some recent studies where authors have shown that resveratrol, a compound found in grapes and red wine, improves the health and life span of mice. Immediately after the online publication of these papers, the scientific community and popular press voiced concerns regarding the relevance of the dose of resveratrol used by the authors. The animal dose should not be extrapolated to a human equivalent dose (HED) by a simple conversion based on body weight, as was reported. For the more appropriate conversion of drug doses from animal studies to human studies, we suggest using the body surface area (BSA) normalization method. BSA correlates well across several mammalian species with several parameters of biology, including oxygen utilization, caloric expenditure, basal metabolism, blood volume, circulating plasma proteins, and renal function. We advocate the use of BSA as a factor when converting a dose for translation from animals to humans, especially for phase I and phase II clinical trials.},

Intrastriatal administration of quinolinic acid (QA) causes neurodegeneration, glial proliferation and cognitive impairment in animals, which are similar to these seen in human HD. Since polyamines improve memory in cognitive tasks, we now tested if the post-training intrastriatal administration of spermine, an agonist of the polyamine site at the NMDA receptor, reverses the deficits in the object recognition task induced by QA. Bilateral striatal injections of QA (180 or 360 nmol/site) caused object recognition impairment, neuronal death and reactive astrogliosis. A single injection of spermine (0.1 and 1 nmol/site), 5 days after QA injection, reversed QA-induced impairment of object recognition task. Sperm-ine (0.1 nmol/site) also inhibited QA-induced reactive astrogliosis measured by a semi-quantitative determination of GFAP immunolabelling, but did not alter neuronal death, measured by a semi-quantitative determination of fluoro-Jade C staining. These results suggest that polyamine binding sites may be considered a novel therapeutic target to prevent reactive astrogliosis and mnemonic deficits in HD.},

With or without consideration of hypertension, cigarette smoking, extremes or gains in body weight, or early parental death, alumni mortality rates were significantly lower among the physically active. Relative risks of death for individuals were highest among cigarette smokers and men with hypertension, and attributable risks in the community were highest among smokers and sedentary men.

abstract = {Promising results have emerged from a phase II clinical trial testing methylene blue (MB) as a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer disease (AD), where improvements in cognitive functions of AD patients after 6 months of MB administration have been reported. Despite these reports, no preclinical testing of MB in mammals has been published, and thus its mechanism of action in relation to AD pathology remains unknown. In order to elucidate the effects of MB on AD pathology and to determine its mechanism of action, we used a mouse model (3xTg-AD) that develops age-dependent accumulation of A$\beta$ and tau and cognitive decline. Here, we report that chronic dietary MB treatment reduces A$\beta$ levels and improves learning and memory deficits in the 3xTg-AD mice. The mechanisms underlying the effects of MB on A$\beta$ pathology appears to be mediated by an increase in A$\beta$ clearance as we show that MB increases the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome in the brain. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that MB increases proteasome function and ameliorates AD-like pathology in vivo. Overall, the data presented here support the use of MB for the treatment of AD and offer a possible mechanism of action.},

This system plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes in living organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. Thus, an accurate and reliable measure of autophagic activity is necessary. However, autophagy involves dynamic and complicated processes that make it difficult to analyze. The term "autophagic flux" is used to denote overall autophagic degradation (i.e., delivery of autophagic cargo to the lysosome) rather than autophagosome formation. Immunoblot analysis of LC3 and p62/SQSTM1, among other proteins, has been widely used to monitor autophagic flux. Here, we describe basic protocols to measure the levels of endogenous LC3 and p62 by immunoblotting in cultured mammalian cells.},

Abnormalities of autophagy, a major pathway to lysosomes for protein and organelle turnover, include marked accumulations of autophagy-related vesicular compartments (autophagic vacuoles or AVs) in affected neurons. Here, we investigated the possibility that AVs contain the proteases and substrates necessary to cleave the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to A?? peptide that forms ??-amyloid, a key pathogenic factor in AD. AVs were highly purified using a well-established metrizamide gradient procedure from livers of transgenic YAC mice overexpressing wild-type human APP. By Western blot analysis, AVs contained APP, ??CTF - the ??-cleaved carboxyl-terminal domain of APP, and BACE, the protease-mediating ??-cleavage of APP. ??-Secretase activity measured against a fluorogenic peptide was significantly enriched in the AV fraction relative to whole-liver lysate. Compared to other recovered subcellular fractions, AVs exhibited the highest specific activity of ??-secretase based on a fluorogenic assay and inhibition by a specific inhibitor of ??-secretase, DAPT. AVs were also the most enriched subcellular fraction in levels of the ??-secretase components presenilin and nicastrin. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated selective immunogold labeling of AVs with antibodies specific for the carboxyl termini of human A??40 and A??42. These data indicate that AVs are a previously unrecognized and potentially highly active compartment for A?? generation and suggest that the abnormal accumulation of AVs in affected neurons of the AD brain contributes to ??-amyloid deposition. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about oxidative stress in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients who present a high risk for developing AD. The aim of this study was to investigate plasma production of the lipid peroxidation marker, malonaldehyde (MDA) and to determine, in erythrocytes, the enzymatic antioxidant activity of catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in 33 individuals with MCI, 29 with mild probable AD and 26 healthy aged subjects. GR/GPx activity ratio was calculated to better assess antioxidant defenses. The relationship between oxidative stress and cognitive performance was also evaluated by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). AD patients showed higher MDA levels than both MCI and healthy elderly subjects. MCI subjects also exhibited higher MDA levels compared to controls. Catalase and GPx activity were similar in MCI and healthy individuals but higher in AD. GR activity was lower in MCI and AD patients than in healthy aged subjects. Additionally, GR/GPx ratio was higher in healthy aged subjects, intermediate in MCI and lower in AD patients. No differences in GST activity were detected among the groups. MMSE was negatively associated with MDA levels (r = -0.31, p = 0.028) and positively correlated with GR/GPx ratio in AD patients (r = 0.68, p {\textless} 0.001). MDA levels were also negatively correlated to GR/GPx ratio (r = -0.31, p = 0.029) in the AD group. These results suggest that high lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant defenses may be present early in cognitive disorders.},

abstract = {As a lysosomal/vacuolar degradative pathway that is conserved in eukaryotic organisms, autophagy mediates the turnover of long-lived proteins and excess or aberrant organelles. The main characteristic of autophagy is the formation of a double-membrane vesicle, the autophagosome, which envelops part of the cytoplasm and delivers it to the lysosome/vacuole for breakdown and eventual recycling of the degradation products. Among the approximately 30 autophagy-related (Atg) genes identified so far, there are two ubiquitin-like proteins, Atg12 and Atg8. Analogous to ubiquitination, Atg12 is conjugated to Atg5 by Atg7--an E1-like protein--and Atg10--an E2-like protein. Similarly, Atg7 and Atg3 are the respective E1-like and E2-like proteins that mediate the conjugation of Atg8 to phosphatidylethanolamine. Both Atg12-Atg5 and Atg8 localize to the developing autophagosome. The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate facilitates the lipidation of Atg8 and directs its correct subcellular localization. Atg8-phosphatidylethanolamine is probably a scaffold protein that supports membrane expansion and the amount present correlates with the size of autophagosomes.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects the elderly. The increase of life-expectancy is transforming AD into a major health-care problem. AD is characterized by a progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive skills leading to dementia. The major pathogenic factor associated to AD seems to be amyloid-beta peptide (A$\beta$) oligomers that tend to accumulate extracellularly as amyloid deposits and are associated with reactive microglia and astrocytes as well as with degeneration of neuronal processes. The involvement of microglia and astrocytes in the onset and progress of neurodegenerative process in AD is becoming increasingly recognized, albeit it is commonly accepted that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress can have both detrimental and beneficial influences on the neural tissue. However, little is known about the interplay of microglia, astrocytes and neurons in response to A$\beta$, especially in the early phases of AD. This review discusses current knowledge about the involvement of neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis, focusing on phenotypic and functional responses of microglia, astrocytes and neurons in this process. The abnormal production by glia cells of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and the complement system, as well as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, can disrupt nerve terminals activity causing dysfunction and loss of synapses, which correlates with memory decline; these are phenomena preceding the neuronal death associated with late stages of AD. Thus, therapeutic strategies directed at controlling the activation of microglia and astrocytes and the excessive production of pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant factors may be valuable to control neurodegeneration in dementia.},

abstract = {SNCA and MAPT genes and environmental factors are important risk factors of Parkinson's disease [PD], the second-most common neurodegenerative disease. The agrichemicals maneb and paraquat selectively target dopaminergic neurons, leading to parkinsonism, through ill-defined mechanisms. In the current studies we have analyzed the ability of maneb and paraquat, separately and together, to induce synucleinopathy and tauopathy in wild type mice. Maneb was ineffective in increasing $\alpha$-synuclein [$\alpha$-Syn] or p-Tau levels. By contrast, paraquat treatment of mice resulted in robust accumulation of $\alpha$-Syn and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in striata, through activation of p-GSK-3$\beta$, a major Tau kinase. Co-treatment with maneb did not enhance the effects of paraquat. Increased hyperacetylation of $\alpha$-tubulin was observed in paraquat-treated mice, suggesting cytoskeleton remodeling. Paraquat, but not maneb, inhibited soluble proteasomal activity on a peptide substrate but this was not associated with a decreased expression of 26S proteasome subunits. Both paraquat and maneb treatments increased levels of the autophagy inhibitor, mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, suggesting impaired axonal autophagy, despite increases in certain autophagic proteins, such as beclin 1 and Agt12. Autophagic flux was also impaired, as ratios of LC3 II to LC3 I were reduced in treated animals. Increased mTOR was also observed in postmortem human PD striata, where there was a reduction in the LC3 II to LC3 I ratio. Heat shock proteins were either increased or unchanged upon paraquat-treatment suggesting that chaperone-mediated autophagy is not hampered by the agrichemicals. These studies provide novel insight into the mechanisms of action of these agrichemicals, which indicate that paraquat is much more toxic than maneb, via its inhibitory effects on proteasomes and autophagy, which lead to accumulation of $\alpha$-Syn and p-Tau.},

Preceding functional experiments consisted of depleting LC3B and p62 in H1299 lung cancer cells with subsequent induction of autophagy. Western blot and immunofluorescence validated antibody specificity, knockdown efficiency and autophagy induction prior to fixation in formalin and embedding in paraffin. LC3B and p62 antibodies were validated on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded cell pellets of treated and control cells and finally applied on a tissue microarray with 80 human malignant and non-neoplastic lung and stomach formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples. Dot-like staining of various degrees was observed in cell pellets and 18/40 (LC3B) and 22/40 (p62) tumors, respectively. Seventeen tumors were double positive for LC3B and p62. P62 displayed additional significant cytoplasmic and nuclear staining of unknown significance. Interobserver-agreement for grading of staining intensities and patterns was substantial to excellent (kappa values 0.60 - 0.83). In summary, we present a specific and reliable IHC staining of LC3B and p62 on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded human tissue.

In this review we focus on mammalian autophagy, and we give an overview of the understanding of its machinery and the signaling cascades that regulate it.

abstract = {Superoxide generation by mitochondria respiratory complexes is a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are capable of initiating redox signaling and oxidative damage. Current understanding of the role of mitochondrial ROS in health and disease has been limited by the lack of experimental strategies to selectively induce mitochondrial superoxide production. The recently-developed mitochondria-targeted redox cycler MitoParaquat (MitoPQ) overcomes this limitation, and has proven effective in vitro and in Drosophila. Here we present an in vivo study of MitoPQ in the vertebrate zebrafish model in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), and in a human cell model of Huntington's disease (HD). We show that MitoPQ is 100-fold more potent than non-targeted paraquat in both cells and in zebrafish in vivo. Treatment with MitoPQ induced a parkinsonian phenotype in zebrafish larvae, with decreased sensorimotor reflexes, spontaneous movement and brain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels, without detectable effects on heart rate or atrioventricular coordination. Motor phenotypes and TH levels were partly rescued with antioxidant or monoaminergic potentiation strategies. In a HD cell model, MitoPQ promoted mutant huntingtin aggregation without increasing cell death, contrasting with the complex I inhibitor rotenone that increased death in cells expressing either wild-type or mutant huntingtin. These results show that MitoPQ is a valuable tool for cellular and in vivo studies of the role of mitochondrial superoxide generation in redox biology, and as a trigger or co-stressor to model metabolic and neurodegenerative disease phenotypes.},

abstract = {In complex with the immunophilin FKBP12, the natural product rapamycin inhibits signal transduction events required for G1 to S phase cell cycle progression in yeast and mammalian cells. Genetic studies in yeast first implicated the TOR1 and TOR2 proteins as targets of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. We report here that the TOR2 protein is membrane associated and localized to the surface of the yeast vacuole. Immunoprecipitated TOR2 protein contains readily detectable phosphatidylinositol-4 (PI-4) kinase activity attributable to either a TOR2 intrinsic activity or to a PI-4 kinase tightly associated with TOR2. Importantly, we find that rapamycin stimulates FKBP12 binding to wild-type TOR2 but not to a rapamycin-resistant TOR2-1 mutant protein. Surprisingly, FKBP12-rapamycin binding does not markedly inhibit the PI kinase activity associated with TOR2, but does cause a delocalization of TOR2 from the vacuolar surface, which may deprive the TOR2-associated PI-4 kinase activity of its in vivo substrate. Several additional findings indicate that vacuolar localization is important for TOR2 function and, conversely, that TOR2 modulates vacuolar morphology and segregation. These studies demonstrate that TOR2 is an essential, highly conserved component of a signal transduction pathway regulating cell cycle progression conserved from yeast to man.},

abstract = {Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by intracellular, aggregate-prone proteins, including polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin in Huntington's disease (HD) and mutant tau in fronto-temporal dementia/tauopathy. Previously, we showed that rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, enhances mutant huntingtin fragment clearance and attenuated toxicity. Here we show much wider applications for this approach. Rapamycin enhances the autophagic clearance of different proteins with long polyglutamines and a polyalanine-expanded protein, and reduces their toxicity. Rapamycin also reduces toxicity in Drosophila expressing wild-type or mutant forms of tau and these effects can be accounted for by reductions in insoluble tau. Thus, our studies suggest that the scope for rapamycin as a potential therapeutic in aggregate diseases may be much broader than HD or even polyglutamine diseases.},

Using antibodies specific for the cytosolic tail of lamp2a and others recognizing all lamp2 isoforms, we found that in rat liver lamp2a represents 25{\%} of lamp2s in the lysosome. We show that lamp2a levels in the lysosomal membrane in rat liver and fibroblasts in culture directly correlate with rates of chaperone-mediated autophagy in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. The concentration of other lamp2s in the lysosomal membrane show no correlation under the same conditions. Furthermore, substrate proteins bind to lamp2a but not to other lamp2s. Four positively-charged amino acids uniquely present in the cytosolic tail of lamp2a are required for the binding of substrate proteins. Lamp2a also distributes to an unique subpopulation of perinuclear lysosomes in cultured fibroblasts in response to serum withdrawal, and lamp2a, more than other lamp2s, tends to multimerize. These characteristics may be important for lamp2a to act as a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy.},

Synthetic polyamines were mixed into experimental chows, and 24-week-old Jc1:ICR male mice were fed one of three chows containing differing polyamine concentrations. The spermine and spermidine concentrations in the low, normal, and high polyamine chows were 143 and 224 nmol/g, 160 and 434 nmol/g, and 374 and 1540 nmol/g, respectively. An increase in concentration of polyamine in the blood was found only in mice fed the high polyamine chow at 50 weeks of age. While the body weights of mice in all three groups were similar, the survival rate of mice fed high polyamine chow was significantly higher than those in the other two groups (p = 0.011). Mice fed the high polyamine chow analyzed at 88 weeks of age, corresponding to the end of the study, demonstrated lower incidence of glomerulosclerosis and increased expression of senescence marker protein-30 in both kidney and liver compared to those fed the low polyamine chow. As these pathological changes are associated with senescence, oral polyamine appears to inhibit the progression of age-associated pathologies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Autophagy is an intracellular degradation system, by which cytoplasmic contents are degraded in lysosomes. Autophagy is dynamically induced by nutrient depletion to provide necessary amino acids within cells, thus helping them adapt to starvation. Although it has been suggested that mTOR is a major negative regulator of autophagy, how it controls autophagy has not yet been determined. Here, we report a novel mammalian autophagy factor, Atg13, which forms a stable approximately 3-MDa protein complex with ULK1 and FIP200. Atg13 localizes on the autophagic isolation membrane and is essential for autophagosome formation. In contrast to yeast counterparts, formation of the ULK1-Atg13-FIP200 complex is not altered by nutrient conditions. Importantly, mTORC1 is incorporated into the ULK1-Atg13-FIP200 complex through ULK1 in a nutrient-dependent manner and mTOR phosphorylates ULK1 and Atg13. ULK1 is dephosphorylated by rapamycin treatment or starvation. These data suggest that mTORC1 suppresses autophagy through direct regulation of the approximately 3-MDa ULK1-Atg13-FIP200 complex.},

Putrescine had an acute oral toxicity of 2000 mg/kg body weight and spermidine and spermine each of 600 mg/kg body weight. All amines investigated caused a dose-related decrease in blood pressure after intravenous administration, except for tyramine, where an increase was found.

Tyramine and cadaverine were given at levels of 0, 200, 2000 or 10,000 ppm, spermine and putrescine at levels of 0, 200, 2000 or 5000 ppm and spermidine at levels of 0, 20, 200 or 500/1000 ppm in the first study and at levels of 0 or 10,000 ppm in a second study. Spermine was the most toxic. The high dose level showed a great number of changes, such as emaciation, aggressiveness, convulsions and paralysis of the hind legs. Growth, food intake and water intake were considerably decreased. Slight anaemia (males) and changes in plasma clinical chemistry occurred. The relative weights of the thyroid, adrenals, spleen and heart were increased and that of the liver decreased. Impaired kidney function, together with renal histopathological changes and changes in plasma electrolytes and urea, occurred with spermine. Histopathological examinations also revealed decreased glycogen content in the liver, reduction of spermatogenesis, severe depletion of splenic white pulp, acute involution of the thymus and moderate myocardial degeneration in the heart. Myocardial degeneration was also seen in one mid-dose male. Adverse effects were also observed in the top dose groups of all other amines. Decreased body weights associated with diminished food intake were generally seen. Slight increases in packed cell volume, haemoglobin concentration and thrombocytes occurred with cadaverine.

PolyQ expansion may induce neurodegeneration by impairing proteostasis, but protein aggregation and toxicity tend to confound conventional measurements of protein stability. Here, we used optical pulse labeling to measure effects of polyQ expansions on the mean lifetime of a fragment of huntingtin, the protein that causes Huntington's disease, in living neurons. We show that polyQ expansion reduced the mean lifetime of mutant huntingtin within a given neuron and that the mean lifetime varied among neurons, indicating differences in their capacity to clear the polypeptide. We found that neuronal longevity is predicted by the mean lifetime of huntingtin, as cortical neurons cleared mutant huntingtin faster and lived longer than striatal neurons. Thus, cell type-specific differences in turnover capacity may contribute to cellular susceptibility to toxic proteins, and efforts to bolster proteostasis in Huntington's disease, such as protein clearance, could be neuroprotective.},

Recent identification of genes linked to familial forms of PD such as Parkin and PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) has revealed that ubiquitylation and mitochondrial integrity are key factors in disease pathogenesis. However, the exact mechanism underlying the functional interplay between Parkin-catalyzed ubiquitylation and PINK1-regulated mitochondrial quality control remains an enigma. In this study, we show that PINK1 is rapidly and constitutively degraded under steady-state conditions in a mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent manner and that a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential stabilizes PINK1 mitochondrial accumulation. Furthermore, PINK1 recruits Parkin from the cytoplasm to mitochondria with low membrane potential to initiate the autophagic degradation of damaged mitochondria. Interestingly, the ubiquitin ligase activity of Parkin is repressed in the cytoplasm under steady-state conditions; however, PINK1-dependent mitochondrial localization liberates the latent enzymatic activity of Parkin. Some pathogenic mutations of PINK1 and Parkin interfere with the aforementioned events, suggesting an etiological importance. These results provide crucial insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of PD.},

To determine the molecular pathway of chloroquine-induced neuronal cell death, we examined the effects of chloroquine on primary telencephalic neuronal cultures derived from mice with targeted gene disruptions in p53, and various caspase and bcl-2 family members. In wild-type neurons, chloroquine produced con-centration-and time-dependent accumulation of autophagosomes, caspase-3 activation, and cell death. Cell death was inhibited by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagic vacuole formation, but not by Boc-Asp-FMK (BAF), a broad caspase inhibitor. Targeted gene disruptions of p53 and bax inhibited and bcl-x potentiated chloroquine-induced neuron death. Caspase-9-and caspase-3-deficient neurons were not protected from chloroquine cytotoxicity. These studies indicate that chloroquine activates a regulated cell death pathway that partially overlaps with the apoptotic cascade.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reduced TOR signaling has been shown to significantly increase lifespan in a variety of organisms [1], [2], [3], [4]. It was recently demonstrated that long-term treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway[5], or ablation of the mTOR target p70S6K[6] extends lifespan in mice, possibly by delaying aging. Whether inhibition of the mTOR pathway would delay or prevent age-associated disease such as AD remained to be determined.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used rapamycin administration and behavioral tools in a mouse model of AD as well as standard biochemical and immunohistochemical measures in brain tissue to provide answers for this question. Here we show that long-term inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin prevented AD-like cognitive deficits and lowered levels of Abeta(42), a major toxic species in AD[7], in the PDAPP transgenic mouse model. These data indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can reduce Abeta(42) levels in vivo and block or delay AD in mice. As expected from the inhibition of mTOR, autophagy was increased in neurons of rapamycin-treated transgenic, but not in non-transgenic, PDAPP mice, suggesting that the reduction in Abeta and the improvement in cognitive function are due in part to increased autophagy, possibly as a response to high levels of Abeta.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, an intervention that extends lifespan in mice, can slow or block AD progression in a transgenic mouse model of the disease. Rapamycin, already used in clinical settings, may be a potentially effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.},

abstract = {Caloric restriction (CR) is known to extend lifespan in most organisms, indicating that nutrient and energy regulatory mechanisms impact aging. The greatest risk factor for neurodegeneration is age; thus, the antiaging effects of CR might attenuate progressive cell death and avert the aggregation of abnormal proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. CR is a potent inducer of autophagy, a tightly regulated intracellular process that facilitates recycling of abnormal protein aggregates and damaged organelles into bioenergetic and biosynthetic materials to maintain homeostasis. Thus, dysregulated autophagy can lead to cellular dysfunction, abnormal protein accumulation, proteotoxicity and subsequently the onset of several neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the targeted and precision-controlled activation of autophagy represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions that delay aging by modulating specific stages of autophagy might be beneficial against premature aging, neurodegeneration and its associated ailments. However, the dynamic and often compensatory cross-talk that exists between the protein degradation pathways makes clinical translational approaches challenging. Here we review the primary autophagy pathways in the context of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on compensatory mechanisms and pathway failure. By critically assessing each underlying molecular machinery, we reveal their impact on aging and unmask the role of caloric restriction in changing cellular fate by delayed aging through stimulation of autophagy. This may point towards novel and better targeted interventions that exploit the autophagic machinery in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Aim and Background: Spermidine, a naturally occurring polyamine, is involved in various internal biological functions, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. A decreased level of polyamines is associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington disease (HD). 3-Nitropropanoic acid (3-NP) induces a spectrum of HD-like neuropathologies in rat striatum and thus serves as a good experimental model of HD. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether spermidine confers neuroprotection against 3-NP-induced striatal toxicity and to explore its possible mechanism. Methods: Rats were administered 3-NP (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 21 days. Spermidine (5 and 10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) was administered once a day 1 h before 3-NP treatment for 21 days. Body weight and behavioral observations were recorded at weekly intervals after continuous 3-NP treatment. On the 22nd day, the animals were sacrificed, and the rat striatum was isolated for the estimation of biochemical parameters (lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione (GSH), and nitrite), determination of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$ and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1$\beta$), and neurochemical analysis (gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), 5-HT, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine). Results: The findings of the present study demonstrate significant alterations in motor coordination, oxidative defense, and the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6, and IL-1$\beta$) and striatal neurotransmitters upon 3-NP treatment. Pretreatment with spermidine significantly attenuated 3-NP-induced alterations in motor coordination, oxidative stress, and the levels of neuroinflammatory markers and striatal neurotransmitters. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that spermidine exerted a potential neuroprotective effect in a 3-NP model of HD, which may provide insight into the therapeutic potential of spermidine for HD.},

abstract = {In a variety of neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and some types of Parkinson's disease, tau protein is abnormally hyperphosphorylated by several kinases and eventually aggregates to form neurofibrillary tangles, a neurotoxic pathological characteristic that closely correlates with cognitive impairments. Hence, targeting hyperphosphorylated tau protein has now been considered as a valid therapeutic approach for these neurodegenerative tauopathies. As a newly developed analog of rapamycin, temsirolimus was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Recent findings suggested that temsirolimus also provided beneficial effects in animal models of Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, two neurodegenerative diseases caused by accumulation of aberrant proteins within brain. To date, the therapeutic potentials of temsirolimus in neurodegenerative tauopathies have not been determined. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time that temsirolimus treatment effectively enhanced autophagic clearance of hyperphosphorylated tau in okadaic acid-incubated SH-SY5Y cells and in brain of P301S transgenic mice. Meanwhile, we showed that inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3$\beta$, the most important tau kinase, might contribute to the temsirolimus-induced reduction of tau hyperphosphorylation in these two tauopathy models. More importantly, temsirolimus administration rescued spatial learning and memory impairments in P301S transgenic mice. These findings highlight temsirolimus administration as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative tauopathies.},

In addition to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, emerging evidence points to the importance of autophagy--the bulk protein degradation pathway involved in starvation-induced and constitutive protein turnover--in the protein quality-control process. However, little is known about the precise roles of autophagy in neurons. Here we report that loss of Atg7 (autophagy-related 7), a gene essential for autophagy, leads to neurodegeneration. We found that mice lacking Atg7 specifically in the central nervous system showed behavioural defects, including abnormal limb-clasping reflexes and a reduction in coordinated movement, and died within 28 weeks of birth. Atg7 deficiency caused massive neuronal loss in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. Notably, polyubiquitinated proteins accumulated in autophagy-deficient neurons as inclusion bodies, which increased in size and number with ageing. There was, however, no obvious alteration in proteasome function. Our results indicate that autophagy is essential for the survival of neural cells, and that impairment of autophagy is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders involving ubiquitin-containing inclusion bodies.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a dynamic process during which isolation membranes package substrates to form autophagosomes that are fused with lysosomes to form autolysosomes for degradation. Although it is agreed that the LC3II-associated mature autophagosomes move along microtubular tracks, it is still in dispute if the conversion of LC3I to LC3II before autophagosomes are fully mature and subsequent fusion of mature autophagosomes with lysosomes require microtubules. We use biochemical markers of autophagy and a collection of microtubule interfering reagents to test the question. Results show that interruption of microtubules with either microtubule stabilizing paclitaxel or destabilizing nocodazole similarly impairs the conversion of LC3I to LC3II, but does not block the degradation of LC3II-associated autophagosomes. Acetylation of microtubules renders them resistant to nocodazole treatment. Treatment with vinblastine that causes depolymerization of both non-acetylated and acetylated microtubules results in impairment of both LC3I-LC3II conversion and LC3II-associated autophagosome fusion with lysosomes. Acetylated microtubules are required for fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolysosomes.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy, a lysosomal pathway responsible for the turnover of organelles and long-lived proteins, has been regarded mainly as an inducible process in neurons, which is mobilized in states of stress and injury. New studies show, however, that macroautophagy is also constitutively active in healthy neurons and is vital to cell survival. Neurons in the brain, unlike cells in the periphery, are protected from large-scale autophagy induction because they can use several different energy sources optimally, receive additional nutrients and neurotrophin support from glial cells, and benefit from hypothalamic regulation of peripheral nutrient supplies. Due to its exceptional efficiency, constitutive autophagy in healthy neurons proceeds in the absence of easily detectable autophagic vacuole intermediates. These intermediates can accumulate rapidly, however, when late steps in the autophagic process are blocked. Autophagic vacuoles also accumulate abnormally in affected neurons of several major neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, where they have been linked to various aspects of disease pathogenesis including neuronal cell death. The build-up of autophagic vacuoles in these neurological disorders and others may reflect either heightened autophagy induction, impairment in later digestive steps in the autophagy pathway, or both. Determining the basis for AV accumulation is critical for understanding the pathogenic significance of autophagy in a given pathologic state and for designing possible therapies based on modulating autophagy. In this review, we discuss the special features of autophagy regulation in the brain, its suspected roles in neurodevelopment and plasticity, and recent progress toward understanding how dysfunctional autophagy contributes to neurodegenerative disease. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Familial AD mutations in presenilin are known to exacerbate lysosomal pathology. Hence, we sought to elucidate the function endogenous, wild-type presenilins play in autophagy-mediated protein degradation. We report the finding that genetic deletion or knockdown of presenilins alters many autophagy-related proteins demonstrating a buildup of autophagosomes, indicative of dysfunction in the system. Presenilin-deficient cells inefficiently clear long-lived proteins and fail to build up autophagosomes when challenged with lysosomal inhibitors. Our studies further show that $\gamma$-secretase inhibitors do not adversely impact autophagy, indicating that the role of presenilins in autophagy is independent of $\gamma$-secretase activity. Based on our findings, we conclude that endogenous, wild-type presenilins are necessary for proper protein degradation through the autophagosome-lysosome system by functioning at the lysosomal level. The role of presenilins in autophagy has many implications for its function in neurological diseases such as AD.},

It has been reported that autophagic flux is altered in patients with AD, and application of the autophagy enhancer rapamycin may alleviate the cognitive impairment and amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) neuropathology in transgenic animal model of AD. Since rapamycin is also an immune suppressor, there is a concern that long-term use of rapamycin may bring severe unwanted side effects. The aim of this study is to test if carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-epileptic drug that has a potent autophagy enhancement effect, has anti-AD effects in APP(swe)/PS1(deltaE9) transgenic mice model of AD. We found that APP(swe)/PS1(deltaE9) mice display increased autophagic activity accompanied by decreased mTOR activity. After three months treatment with CBZ in the APP(swe)/PS1(deltaE9) mice, we demonstrated that the spatial learning and memory deficits in these mice are significantly alleviated. We also documented that the cerebral amyloid plaque burden and A$\beta$42 levels in these mice are significantly reduced. Furthermore, we showed that CBZ significantly enhances the autophagic flux in the APP(swe)/PS1(deltaE9) mice which is unlikely via mTOR-dependent autophagy pathway. These data suggest that long-term CBZ treatment may have a protective effect in AD mouse model possibly through enhancing the autophagic flux.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are important aspects of pathogenesis, particularly in the brain, which is highly dependent on oxygen, and the protection of astrocytes is essential for neuroprotection. In this context, imidazoline drugs have been reported to be neuroprotective. Our recent study showed that imidazoline drugs, including guanabenz, inhibit the naphthazarin-induced oxidative cytotoxicity associated with lysosomal destabilization. We now report on a study into the protective effects of rilmenidine and AGN 192403, which have affinity for imidazoline-1 receptors, on the cytotoxicity induced by naphthazarin and inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration in astrocytes. Cytotoxicity was measured grossly by LDH release and by measuring changes in lysosomal membrane stability and features of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Naphthazarin-induced cytotoxicity was evidenced by the ordered development of lysosomal acridine orange relocation, decrease in mitochondrial potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 activation, and was inhibited by guanabenz, rilmenidine, and AGN 192403. Antimycin A and rotenone induced mitochondrial dysfunction primarily, and their cytotoxicities were inhibited only by AGN 192403. Rilmenidine and guanabenz may have a lysosomal stabilizing effect, which underlies their protective effects. AGN 192403 might affect the mitochondrial cell death cascades, and had a novel protective effect on the cytotoxicity associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {The ATP-dependent proton pump V-ATPase ensures low intralysosomal pH, which is essential for lysosomal hydrolase activity. Based on studies with the V-ATPase inhibitor BafilomycinA1, lysosomal acidification is also thought to be required for fusion with incoming vesicles from the autophagic and endocytic pathways. Here we show that loss of V-ATPase subunits in the Drosophila fat body causes an accumulation of non-functional lysosomes, leading to a block in autophagic flux. However, V-ATPase-deficient lysosomes remain competent to fuse with autophagosomes and endosomes, resulting in a time-dependent formation of giant autolysosomes. In contrast, BafilomycinA1 prevents autophagosome-lysosome fusion in these cells, and this defect is phenocopied by depletion of the Ca(2+) pump SERCA, a secondary target of this drug. Moreover, activation of SERCA promotes fusion in a BafilomycinA1-sensitive manner. Collectively, our results indicate that lysosomal acidification is not a prerequisite for fusion, and that BafilomycinA1 inhibits fusion independent of its effect on lysosomal pH.},

abstract = {The quality control of skeletal muscle is a continuous requirement throughout the lifetime, although its functions and quality present as a declining trend during aging process. Dysfunctional or deficient autophagy and excessive apoptosis may contribute to the atrophy of senescent skeletal muscle. Spermidine, as a natural polyamine, can be involved in important cellular functions for lifespan extension and stress resistance in several model organisms through activating autophagy. Similarly, cellular autophagic responses to exercise have also been exte nsively investigated. In the present study, in order to confirm the mitigation or amelioration of skeletal muscle atrophy in aging rats through spermidine coupled with exercise intervention and explore corresponding mechanisms, the rat model with aging-related atrophy of skeletal muscle was established by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose (D-gal) (200 mg/kg{\textperiodcentered}d), and model rats were subjected to the intervention with spermidine (5 mg/kg{\textperiodcentered}d) or swimming (60 min/d, 5 d/wk) or combination for 42 days. Spermidine coupled with exercise could attenuate D-gal-induced aging-related atrophy of skeletal muscle through induced autophagy and reduced apoptosis with characteristics of more autophagosomes, activated mitophagy, enhanced mitochondrial quality, alleviated cell shrinkage, and less swollen mitochondria under transmission scanning microscopic observation. Meanwhile, spermidine coupled with exercise could induce autophagy through activating AMPK-FOXO3a signal pathway with characterization of increased Beclin1 and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, up-regulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, down-regulated pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase-3, as well as activated AMPK and FOXO3a. Therefore, spermidine combined with exercise can execute the prevention or treatment of D-galinduced aging-related skeletal muscle atrophy through enhanced autophagy and reduced apoptosis mediated by AMPK-FOXO3a signal pathway.},

The autophagosome cargo is delivered to the lysosome, broken down, and the resulting amino acids recycled after release back into the cytosol. Autophagy occurs in all eukaryotes and can be up-regulated in response to various nutrient limitations. Under these conditions, autophagy may become essential for viability. In addition, autophagy plays a role in certain diseases, acting to prevent some types of neurodegeneration and cancer, and in the elimination of invading pathogens. We review the current information on the mechanism of autophagy, with a focus on its role in protein metabolism and intracellular homeostasis.},

M., and Wood, N. W. (2004) Brain 127, 2385-2405). Here we demonstrate that the accumulation of mutant Huntingtin is highly sensitive to the expression of beclin 1, a gene essential for autophagy. Moreover, we show that the accumulated mutant Huntingtin recruits Beclin 1 and impairs the Beclin 1-mediated long lived protein turnover. Thus, sequestration of Beclin 1 in the vulnerable neuronal population of Huntington disease patients might further reduce Beclin 1 function and autophagic degradation of mutant Huntingtin. Finally, we demonstrate that the expression of beclin 1 decreases in an age-dependent fashion in human brains. Because beclin 1 gene is haploid insufficient in regulating autophagosome function (Qu, X., Yu, J., Bhagat, G., Furuya, N., Hibshoosh, H., Troxel, A., Rosen, J., Eskelinen, E.

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) containing plaques and tau-laden neurofibrillary tangles are the defining neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To better mimic this neuropathology, we generated a novel triple transgenic model of AD (3xTg-AD) harboring three mutant genes: $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein ($\beta$APPSwe), presenilin-1 (PS1M146V), and tauP301L. The 3xTg-AD mice progressively develop A$\beta$ and tau pathology, with a temporal- and regional-specific profile that closely mimics their development in the human AD brain. We find that A$\beta$ deposits initiate in the cortex and progress to the hippocampus with aging, whereas tau pathology is first apparent in the hippocampus and then progresses to the cortex. Despite equivalent overexpression of the human $\beta$APP and human tau transgenes, A$\beta$ deposition develops prior to the tangle pathology, consistent with the amyloid cascade hypothesis. As these 3xTg-AD mice phenocopy critical aspects of AD neuropathology, this model will be useful in pre-clinical intervention trials, particularly because the efficacy of anti-AD compounds in mitigating the neurodegenerative effects mediated by both signature lesions can be evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Macroautophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway essential for neuron survival. Here, we show that macroautophagy requires the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related protein presenilin-1 (PS1). In PS1 null blastocysts, neurons from mice hypomorphic for PS1 or conditionally depleted of PS1, substrate proteolysis and autophagosome clearance during macroautophagy are prevented as a result of a selective impairment of autolysosome acidification and cathepsin activation. These deficits are caused by failed PS1-dependent targeting of the v-ATPase V0a1 subunit to lysosomes. N-glycosylation of the V0a1 subunit, essential for its efficient ER-to-lysosome delivery, requires the selective binding of PS1 holoprotein to the unglycosylated subunit and the Sec61alpha/oligosaccharyltransferase complex. PS1 mutations causing early-onset AD produce a similar lysosomal/autophagy phenotype in fibroblasts from AD patients. PS1 is therefore essential for v-ATPase targeting to lysosomes, lysosome acidification, and proteolysis during autophagy. Defective lysosomal proteolysis represents a basis for pathogenic protein accumulations and neuronal cell death in AD and suggests previously unidentified therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are the aggregates of amyloid-$\beta$ (Α$\beta$) peptide and tau protein. Autophagy is one major cellular pathway leading to the removal of aggregated proteins. We examined the possibility of inducing autophagy to reduce A$\beta$ peptide and the amyloid precursor protein (APP)-derived fragment APP-CTF levels in cell lines and primary neuronal cultures. We found that induction of autophagy either by small-molecule enhancers of rapamycin (SMER)28, a small-molecule enhancer of autophagy, or following starvation greatly decreased the levels of A$\beta$ peptide (apparent EC(50) of ∼10 $\mu$M) and APP-CTF (apparent EC(50) of ∼20 $\mu$M) in a $\gamma$-secretase-independent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy led to a significant accumulation of A$\beta$ peptide and APP-CTF and diminished the effect of SMER28. Three essential components of the autophagic pathway, autophagy-related protein (Atg)5, Beclin1, and Ulk1, were shown to be involved in the degradation of A$\beta$ and APP-CTF, and Atg5 was necessary for the effect of SMER28. In addition, the autophagic marker light chain 3-II cocompartmentalized with APP-CTF. These results support the involvement of autophagy in the clearance of A$\beta$ and APP-CTF. We therefore propose that small molecule enhancers of autophagy, such as SMER28, may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other proteinopathies.},

Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), a widely used SR technique, is based on the principle of single molecule localization. STORM routinely achieves a spatial resolution of 20 to 30 nm, a ten-fold improvement compared to conventional optical microscopy. Among all SR techniques, STORM offers a high spatial resolution with simple optical instrumentation and standard organic fluorescent dyes, but it is also prone to image artifacts and degraded image resolution due to improper sample preparation or imaging conditions. It requires careful optimization of all three aspects-sample preparation, image acquisition, and image reconstruction-to ensure a high-quality STORM image, which will be extensively discussed in this unit. {\textcopyright} 2017 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Autophagy is intimately associated with eukaryotic cell death and apoptosis. Indeed, in some cases the same proteins control both autophagy and apoptosis. Apoptotic signalling can regulate autophagy and conversely autophagy can regulate apoptosis (and most likely other cell death mechanisms). However, the molecular connections between autophagy and cell death are complicated and, in different contexts, autophagy may promote or inhibit cell death. Surprisingly, although we know that, at its core, autophagy involves degradation of sequestered cytoplasmic material, and therefore presumably must be mediating its effects on cell death by degrading something, in most cases we have little idea of what is being degraded to promote autophagy's pro- or anti-death activities. Because autophagy is known to play important roles in health and many diseases, it is critical to understand the mechanisms by which autophagy interacts with and affects the cell death machinery since this will perhaps allow new ways to prevent or treat disease. In the present chapter, we discuss the current state of understanding of these processes.},

abstract = {The multifaceted process of aging inevitably leads to disturbances in cellular metabolism and protein homeostasis. To meet this challenge, cells make use of autophagy, which is probably one of the most important pathways preserving cellular protection under stressful conditions. Thus, efficient autophagic flux is required for healthy aging in many if not all eukaryotic organisms. The regulation of autophagy itself is affected by changing metabolic conditions, but the precise metabolic circuitries are poorly understood. Recently, we found that the nucleocytosolic pool of acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) functions as a major and dominant suppressor of cytoprotective autophagy during aging. Here, we propose an epigenetic mechanism for AcCoA-mediated autophagy suppression that causally involves the regulation of histone acetylation and changes in the autophagy-relevant transcriptome.},

abstract = {Before amyloid formation, peptides cleaved from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) exist as soluble oligomers. These are extremely neurotoxic. Their concentration is strongly correlated with synaptic impairment in animals and parallel cognitive decline in animals and humans. Clinical trials have largely been aimed at removing insoluble beta amyloid in senile plaques and have not reduced soluble load. Even treatment that should remove soluble oligomers has not consistently reduced the load. Failure to significantly improve cognition has frequently been attributed to failure of the amyloid hypothesis or to irreversible alteration in the brain. Instead, trial failures may be because of failure to significantly reduce load of toxic A?? oligomers. Moreover, targeting only synthesis of A?? peptides, only the oligomers themselves, or only the final insoluble amyloid may fail to significantly reduce soluble load because of the interrelationship between these 3 points in the amyloid cascade. Thus, treatments may fail unless trials target simultaneously all 3 points in the equation-"triple therapy". Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and other monitoring tools may in the future provide reliable measurement of soluble load. But currently, only analysis of autopsied brains can provide this data and thus enable proper evaluation and explanation of the outcome of clinical trials. These data are essential before attributing trial failures to the advanced nature of the disease or asserting that failures prove that the theory linking Alzheimer's disease to products of amyloid precursor protein is incorrect. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Disruption of autophagy--a key homeostatic process in which cytosolic components are degraded and recycled through lysosomes--can cause neurodegeneration in tissue culture and in vivo. Upregulation of this pathway may be neuroprotective, and much effort is being invested in developing drugs that cross the blood brain barrier and increase neuronal autophagy. One well-recognized way of inducing autophagy is by food restriction, which upregulates autophagy in many organs including the liver; but current dogma holds that the brain escapes this effect, perhaps because it is a metabolically privileged site. Here, we have re-evaluated this tenet using a novel approach that allows us to detect, enumerate and characterize autophagosomes in vivo. We first validate the approach by showing that it allows the identification and characterization of autophagosomes in the livers of food-restricted mice. We use the method to identify constitutive autophagosomes in cortical neurons and Purkinje cells, and we show that short-term fasting leads to a dramatic upregulation in neuronal autophagy. The increased neuronal autophagy is revealed by changes in autophagosome abundance and characteristics, and by diminished neuronal mTOR activity in vivo, demonstrated by a reduction in levels of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein in Purkinje cells. The increased abundance of autophagosomes in Purkinje cells was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. Our data lead us to speculate that sporadic fasting might represent a simple, safe and inexpensive means to promote this potentially therapeutic neuronal response.},

The level of TBARS was elevated in all regions, with particular statistical significance in the temporal cortex when compared to age-matched controls. SOD activity was significantly decreased in AD frontal and AD temporal cortex, while catalase activity was significantly decreased in AD temporal cortex. There was no significant difference in GSH-Px activity found in any of the regions examined. This study supports the theory that in AD the brain is affected by increased oxidative stress which, when combined with a decrease in SOD activity, produces oxidative alterations, seen most significantly in temporal cortex in AD, where the pathophysiologic changes are most severe.},

abstract = {Conventional two-dimensional cell monolayers do not provide the geometrical, biochemical and mechanical cues found in real tissues. Cells in real tissues interact through chemical and mechanical stimuli with adjacent cells and via the extracellular matrix. Such a highly interconnected communication network extends along all three dimensions. This architecture is lost in two-dimensional cultures. Therefore, at least in many cases, two-dimensional cell monolayers do not represent a suitable in vitro tool to characterize accurately the biology of real tissues. Many studies performed over the last few years have demonstrated that the differences between three-dimensional and two-dimensional cultured cells are striking at the morphological and molecular levels and that three-dimensional cell cultures can be employed in order to shrink the gap between real tissues and in vitro cell models. End-point and long-term imaging of cellular and sub-cellular processes with fluorescence microscopy provides direct insight into the physiological behavior of three-dimensional cell cultures and their response to chemical or mechanical stimulation. Fluorescence imaging of three-dimensional cell cultures sets new challenges and imposes specific requirements concerning the choice of a suitable microscopy technique. Deep penetration into the specimen, high imaging speed and ultra-low intensity of the excitation light are key requirements. Light-sheet-based fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) offers a favorable combination of these requirements and is therefore currently established as the technique of choice for the study of three-dimensional cell cultures. This review illustrates the benefits of cellular spheroids in the life sciences and suggests that LSFM is essential for investigations of cellular and sub-cellular dynamic processes in three-dimensions over time and space.},

abstract = {Trehalose is a nonreducing disaccharide in which the two glucose units are linked in an alpha,alpha-1,1-glycosidic linkage. The best known and most widely distributed pathway of trehalose synthesis involves the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to glucose 6-phosphate to form trehalose-6-phosphate and UDP via the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS1). Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPS2) then converts trehalose-6-phosphate to free trehalose. This sugar is present in a wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, yeast, fungi, insects, invertebrates and plants, and because of its particular physical features, trehalose is able to protect the integrity of cells against a variety of environmental stresses such as desiccation, dehydration, heat, cold and oxidation. Our current studies described here indicate that trehalose protects Drosophila and mammalian cells from hypoxic and anoxic injury. The mechanism of this protection is probably related to a decrease in protein denaturation through protein-trehalose interactions.},

abstract = {Among age-related neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease (PD) represents the best example for which oxidative stress has been strongly implicated. The etiology of PD remains unknown, yet recent epidemiological studies have linked exposure to environmental agents, including pesticides, with an increased risk of developing the disease. As a result, the environmental hypothesis of PD has developed, which speculates that chemical agents in the environment are capable of producing selective dopaminergic cell death, thus contributing to disease development. The use of environmental agents such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, rotenone, paraquat, dieldrin, and maneb in toxicant-based models of PD has become increasingly popular and provided valuable insight into the neurodegenerative process. Understanding the unique and shared mechanisms by which these environmental agents act as selective dopaminergic toxicants is critical in identifying pathways involved in PD pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the neurotoxic properties of these compounds with specific focus on the induction of oxidative stress. We highlight landmark studies along with recent advances that support the role of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species from a variety of cellular sources as potent contributors to the neurotoxicity of these environmental agents. Finally, human risk and the implications of these studies in our understanding of PD-related neurodegeneration are discussed.},

The present translational study aimed to determine safety and tolerability of a wheat germ extract containing enhanced spermidine concentrations. In a preclinical toxicity study, supplementation of spermidine using this extract did not result in morbidities or changes in behavior in BALBc/Rj mice during the 28-days repeated-dose tolerance study. Post mortem examination of the mice organs showed no increase in tumorigenic and fibrotic events. In the human cohort (participants with subjective cognitive decline, n=30, 60 to 80 years of age), a 3-month randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase II trial was conducted with supplementation of the spermidine-rich plant extract (dosage: 1.2 mg/day). No differences were observed between spermidine and placebo-treated groups in vital signs, weight, clinical chemistry and hematological parameters of safety, as well as in self-reported health status at the end of intervention. Compliance rates above 85{\%} indicated excellent tolerability. The data demonstrate that spermidine supplementation using a spermidine-rich plant extract is safe and well-tolerated in mice and older adults. These findings allow for longer-term intervention studies in humans to investigate the impact of spermidine treatment on cognition and brain integrity.},

Mutant huntingtin protein and its fragments are resistant to protein degradation and produce a blockade of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). In HD models, the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin aggravates protein accumulation and the inductor of autophagy, trehalose, diminishes it. We have investigated the effects of epoxomicin and trehalose in skin fibroblasts of control and HD patients. Untreated HD fibroblasts have increased the levels of ubiquitinized proteins and higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), huntingtin and the autophagy marker LAMP2A. Baseline replication rates were higher in HD than in controls fibroblasts but that was reverted after 12 passages. Epoxomicin increases the activated caspase-3, HSP70, huntingtin, ubiquitinated proteins and ROS levels in both HD and controls. Treatment with trehalose counteracts the increase in ROS, ubiquitinated proteins, huntingtin and activated caspase-3 levels induced by epoxomicin, and also increases the LC3 levels more in HD fibroblast than controls. These results suggest that trehalose could revert protein processing abnormalities in patients with Huntington's Disease.},

In contrast to fusion with the late endosome, the mechanisms underlying autophagosome-lysosome fusion remain unknown. Here, we identify syntaxin 17 (Stx17) as the autophagosomal SNARE required for fusion with the endosome/lysosome. Stx17 localizes to the outer membrane of completed autophagosomes but not to the isolation membrane (unclosed intermediate structures); for this reason, the lysosome does not fuse with the isolation membrane. Stx17 interacts with SNAP-29 and the endosomal/lysosomal SNARE VAMP8. Depletion of Stx17 causes accumulation of autophagosomes without degradation. Stx17 has a unique C-terminal hairpin structure mediated by two tandem transmembrane domains containing glycine zipper-like motifs, which is essential for its association with the autophagosomal membrane. These findings reveal a mechanism by which the SNARE protein is available to the completed autophagosome.},

CMA declines with age because of a decrease in the levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) type 2A, a lysosomal receptor for this pathway. We have selectively blocked the expression of LAMP-2A in mouse fibroblasts in culture and analyzed the cellular consequences of reduced CMA activity. CMA-defective cells maintain normal rates of long-lived protein degradation by up-regulating macroautophagy, the major form of autophagy. Constitutive up-regulation of macroautophagy is unable, however, to compensate for all CMA functions. Thus, CMA-defective cells are more sensitive to stressors, suggesting that, although protein turnover is maintained, the selectivity of CMA is necessary as part of the cellular response to stress.

abstract = {Accumulation of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) and Tau is an invariant feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). The upstream role of A$\beta$ accumulation in the disease pathogenesis is widely accepted, and there is strong evidence showing that A$\beta$ accumulation causes cognitive impairments. However, the molecular mechanisms linking A$\beta$ to cognitive decline remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the buildup of A$\beta$ increases the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, whereas decreasing mTOR signaling reduces A$\beta$ levels, thereby highlighting an interrelation between mTOR signaling and A$\beta$. The mTOR pathway plays a central role in controlling protein homeostasis and hence, neuronal functions; indeed mTOR signaling regulates different forms of learning and memory. Using an animal model of AD, we show that pharmacologically restoring mTOR signaling with rapamycin rescues cognitive deficits and ameliorates A$\beta$ and Tau pathology by increasing autophagy. Indeed, we further show that autophagy induction is necessary for the rapamycin-mediated reduction in A$\beta$ levels. The results presented here provide a molecular basis for the A$\beta$-induced cognitive deficits and, moreover, show that rapamycin, an FDA approved drug, improves learning and memory and reduces A$\beta$ and Tau pathology.},

abstract = {Chromatin modifications, especially histone-tail acetylation, have been implicated in memory formation. Increased histone-tail acetylation induced by inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACis) facilitates learning and memory in wild-type mice as well as in mouse models of neurodegeneration. Harnessing the therapeutic potential of HDACis requires knowledge of the specific HDAC family member(s) linked to cognitive enhancement. Here we show that neuron-specific overexpression of HDAC2, but not that of HDAC1, decreased dendritic spine density, synapse number, synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Conversely, Hdac2 deficiency resulted in increased synapse number and memory facilitation, similar to chronic treatment with HDACis in mice. Notably, reduced synapse number and learning impairment of HDAC2-overexpressing mice were ameliorated by chronic treatment with HDACis. Correspondingly, treatment with HDACis failed to further facilitate memory formation in Hdac2-deficient mice. Furthermore, analysis of promoter occupancy revealed an association of HDAC2 with the promoters of genes implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Taken together, our results suggest that HDAC2 functions in modulating synaptic plasticity and long-lasting changes of neural circuits, which in turn negatively regulates learning and memory. These observations encourage the development and testing of HDAC2-selective inhibitors for human diseases associated with memory impairment.},

Although the role of Parkin in neuron maintenance is unknown, recent work has linked Parkin to the regulation of mitochondria. Its loss is associated with swollen mitochondria and muscle degeneration in Drosophila melanogaster, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility to mitochondrial toxins in other species. Here, we show that Parkin is selectively recruited to dysfunctional mitochondria with low membrane potential in mammalian cells. After recruitment, Parkin mediates the engulfment of mitochondria by autophagosomes and the selective elimination of impaired mitochondria. These results show that Parkin promotes autophagy of damaged mitochondria and implicate a failure to eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {Many of the neurodegenerative diseases that afflict people are caused by intracytoplasmic aggregate-prone proteins. These include Parkinson disease, tauopathies, and polyglutamine expansion diseases such as Huntington disease. In Mendelian forms of these diseases, the mutations generally confer toxic novel functions on the relevant proteins. Thus, one potential strategy for dealing with these mutant proteins is to enhance their degradation. This can be achieved by up-regulating macroautophagy, which we will henceforth call autophagy. In this minireview, we will consider the reasons why autophagy up-regulation may be a powerful strategy for these diseases. In addition, we will consider some of the drugs and associated signaling pathways that can be used to induce autophagy with these therapeutic aims in mind.},

abstract = {Potential roles for lactate in the energetics of brain activation have changed radically during the past three decades, shifting from waste product to supplemental fuel and signaling molecule. Current models for lactate transport and metabolism involving cellular responses to excitatory neurotransmission are highly debated, owing, in part, to discordant results obtained in different experimental systems and conditions. Major conclusions drawn from tabular data summarizing results obtained in many laboratories are as follows: Glutamate-stimulated glycolysis is not an inherent property of all astrocyte cultures. Synaptosomes from the adult brain and many preparations of cultured neurons have high capacities to increase glucose transport, glycolysis, and glucose-supported respiration, and pathway rates are stimulated by glutamate and compounds that enhance metabolic demand. Lactate accumulation in activated tissue is a minor fraction of glucose metabolized and does not reflect pathway fluxes. Brain activation in subjects with low plasma lactate causes outward, brain-to-blood lactate gradients, and lactate is quickly released in substantial amounts. Lactate utilization by the adult brain increases during lactate infusions and strenuous exercise that markedly increase blood lactate levels. Lactate can be an 'opportunistic', glucose-sparing substrate when present in high amounts, but most evidence supports glucose as the major fuel for normal, activated brain.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-Synuclein-containing aggregates represent a feature of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). However, mechanisms that promote intraneuronal $\alpha$-synuclein assembly remain poorly understood. Because pesticides, particularly the herbicide paraquat, have been suggested to play a role as PD risk factors, the hypothesis that interactions between $\alpha$-synuclein and these environmental agents may contribute to aggregate formation was tested in this study. Paraquat markedly accelerated the in vitro rate of $\alpha$-synuclein fibril formation in a dose-dependent fashion. When mice were exposed to the herbicide, brain levels of $\alpha$-synuclein were significantly increased. This up-regulation followed a consistent pattern, with higher $\alpha$-synuclein at 2 days after each of three weekly paraquat injections and with protein levels returning to control values by day 7 post-treatment. Paraquat exposure was also accompanied by aggregate formation. Thioflavine S-positive structures accumulated within neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, and dual labeling and confocal imaging confirmed that these aggregates contained $\alpha$-synuclein. The results suggest that up-regulation of $\alpha$-synuclein as a consequence of toxicant insult and direct interactions between the protein and environmental agents are potential mechanisms leading to $\alpha$-synuclein pathology in neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {The mechanisms of neuronal death in protein misfolding neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and prion diseases are poorly understood. We used a highly toxic misfolded prion protein (TPrP) model to understand neurotoxicity induced by prion protein misfolding. We show that abnormal autophagy activation and neuronal demise is due to severe, neuron-specific, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) depletion. Toxic prion protein-exposed neuronal cells exhibit dramatic reductions of intracellular NAD+ followed by decreased ATP production, and are completely rescued by treatment with NAD+ or its precursor nicotinamide because of restoration of physiological NAD+ levels. Toxic prion protein-induced NAD+ depletion results from PARP1-independent excessive protein ADP-ribosylations. In vivo, toxic prion protein-induced degeneration of hippocampal neurons is prevented dose-dependently by intracerebral injection of NAD+. Intranasal NAD+ treatment of prion-infected sick mice significantly improves activity and delays motor impairment. Our study reveals NAD+ starvation as a novel mechanism of autophagy activation and neurodegeneration induced by a misfolded amyloidogenic protein. We propose the development of NAD+ replenishment strategies for neuroprotection in prion diseases and possibly other protein misfolding neurodegenerative diseases.

abstract = {The formation of intra-neuronal mutant protein aggregates is a characteristic of several human neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) and polyglutamine disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD). Autophagy is a major clearance pathway for the removal of mutant huntingtin associated with HD, and many other disease-causing, cytoplasmic, aggregate-prone proteins. Autophagy is negatively regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and can be induced in all mammalian cell types by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. It can also be induced by a recently described cyclical mTOR-independent pathway, which has multiple drug targets, involving links between Ca(2+)-calpain-G(salpha) and cAMP-Epac-PLC-epsilon-IP(3) signalling. Both pathways enhance the clearance of mutant huntingtin fragments and attenuate polyglutamine toxicity in cell and animal models. The protective effects of rapamycin in vivo are autophagy-dependent. In Drosophila models of various diseases, the benefits of rapamycin are lost when the expression of different autophagy genes is reduced, implicating that its effects are not mediated by autophagy-independent processes (like mild translation suppression). Also, the mTOR-independent autophagy enhancers have no effects on mutant protein clearance in autophagy-deficient cells. In this review, we describe various drugs and pathways inducing autophagy, which may be potential therapeutic approaches for HD and related conditions.},

We surmise that there are 3 possibilities to mimic these effects, namely (i) the depletion of cytosolic AcCoA by interfering with its biosynthesis, (ii) the inhibition of acetyltransferases, which are enzymes that transfer acetyl groups from AcCoA to other molecules, mostly leucine residues in cellular proteins, or (iii) the stimulation of deacetylases, which catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from leucine residues. There are several examples of rather nontoxic natural compounds that act as AcCoA depleting agents (e.g., hydroxycitrate), acetyltransferase inhibitors (e.g., anacardic acid, curcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, garcinol, spermidine) or deacetylase activators (e.g., nicotinamide, resveratrol), and that are highly efficient inducers of autophagy in vitro and in vivo, in rodents. Another common characteristic of these agents is their capacity to reduce aging-associated diseases and to confer protective responses against ischemia-induced organ damage. Hence, we classify them as "caloric restriction mimetics" (CRM). Here, we speculate that CRM may mediate their broad health-improving effects by triggering the same molecular pathways that usually are elicited by long-term caloric restriction or short-term starvation and that imply the induction of autophagy as an obligatory event conferring organismal, organ- or cytoprotection.},

abstract = {Cerebral accumulation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is an early and invariant event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mutations in the presenilin (PS) 1 and 2 genes that increase production of the highly amyloidogenic Abeta(42) are the most common cause of familial AD. Deletion of PS1 in mice reduces Abeta generation, indicating that PS1 mediates the last step in the generation of Abeta from beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the unidentified gamma-secretase. Mutating either of two conserved transmembrane aspartates in PS1 significantly reduced Abeta production and increased the APP C-terminal fragments that are gamma-secretase substrates. These results indicate that PS1 is either a unique diaspartyl cofactor for gamma-secretase or is itself gamma-secretase. Furthermore, studies on the gamma-secretase-like proteolytic processing of Notch and Ire1 suggest a common mechanism for the involvement of PS1 in intramembrane proteolysis of membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a degradation pathway for the turnover of dysfunctional organelles or aggregated proteins in cells. Extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide has been reported to be a major cause of Alzheimer disease (AD) and large numbers of autophagic vacuoles accumulate in the brain of AD patient. However, how autophagic process is involved in Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and how Abeta peptide is transported into the neuron and metabolized is still unknown. In order to study the role of autophagic process in Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, EGFP-LC3 was overexpressed in SH-SY5Y cells (SH-SY5Y/pEGFP-LC3). It was found that treatment with Abeta(25-35), Abeta(1-42) or serum-starvation induced strong autophagy response in SH-SY5Y/pEGFP-LC3. Confocal double-staining image showed that exogenous application of Abeta(1-42) in medium caused the colocalization of Abeta(1-42) with LC3 in neuronal cells. Concomitant treatment of Abeta with a selective alpha7nAChR antagonist, alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX), enhanced Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. On the other hand, nicotine (nAChR agonist) enhanced the autophagic process and also inhibited cell death following Abeta application. In addition, nicotine but not alpha-BTX increased primary hippocampal neuronal survival following Abeta treatment. Furthermore, using Atg7 siRNA to inhibit autophagosome formation in an early step or alpha7nAChR siRNA to knock down alpha7nAChR significantly enhanced Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Confocal double-staining imaging shows that nicotine treatment in the presence of Abeta enhanced the colocalization of alpha7nAChR with autophagosomes. These results suggest that alpha7nAChR may act as a carrier to bind with eAbeta and internalize into cytoplasm and further inhibit Abeta-induced neurotoxicity via autophagic degradation pathway. Our results suggest that autophagy process plays a neuroprotective role against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Defect in autophagic regulation or Abeta-alpha7nAChR transport system may impair the clearance of Abeta and enhance neuronal death.},

abstract = {We examined the toxicity of paraquat, a possible environmental risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD). Paraquat is structurally similar to the neurotoxin MPP+ that can induce Parkinsonian-like features in rodents, non-human primates and human. Exposure of cerebellar granule cells to relatively low concentrations of paraquat (5 $\mu$M) produces apoptotic cell death with a reduction in mitochondrial cytochrome c content, proteolytic activation and caspase-3 activity increase and DNA fragmentation. Paraquat-induced apoptosis was significantly attenuated by co-treatment of cerebellar granule cells with the radical scavenger vitamin E, suggesting that paraquat-induced free radicals serve as important signal in initiation of cell death. As a decrease in mitochondrial cytochrome c content is also prevented by allopurinol, we suggest that xanthine oxidase plays an important role in the free radical production that precedes the apoptotic cascade and cell death after paraquat exposition. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In skin, the level of spermidine was maximal in 10-week-old mice and markedly reduced in 26-week-old mice.

The most prevalent genetic risk factor is the $\epsilon$4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE). Neuropathological studies of young deceased $\epsilon$4 carriers have shown modest but abnormal amounts of neocortical amyloid and medial temporal neurofibrillary tangles that is also reflected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, amyloid-$\beta$, and phospho-tau in particular. MRI studies have shown progressive hippocampal and gray matter atrophy with the advent of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans show reduced cerebral metabolism in posterior cingulate and related AD regions evident even in 30 year olds. Cerebral amyloidosis disclosed by more recent amyloid ligand PET studies in asymptomatic 60 year olds increases in parallel with $\epsilon$4 gene dose. Longitudinal neuropsychological studies have revealed accelerated memory decline in $\epsilon$4 carriers beginning around age 55-60 years whose severity again parallels $\epsilon$4 gene dose. The clinico-pathological correlation of declining memory and AD-like neuropathological change defines preclinical AD and has set the stage for the accelerated evaluation of presymptomatic AD treatments. In this article, we briefly consider some of the earliest detectable changes associated with the predisposition to AD, and some of the prevention trial strategies that have been proposed to help find treatments to reduce the risk, postpone the onset of, or completely prevent AD symptoms as soon as possible.},

abstract = {A long-standing controversy is whether autophagy is a bona fide cause of mammalian cell death. We used a cell-penetrating autophagy-inducing peptide, Tat-Beclin 1, derived from the autophagy protein Beclin 1, to investigate whether high levels of autophagy result in cell death by autophagy. Here we show that Tat-Beclin 1 induces dose-dependent death that is blocked by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy, but not of apoptosis or necroptosis. This death, termed "autosis," has unique morphological features, including increased autophagosomes/autolysosomes and nuclear convolution at early stages, and focal swelling of the perinuclear space at late stages. We also observed autotic death in cells during stress conditions, including in a subpopulation of nutrient-starved cells in vitro and in hippocampal neurons of neonatal rats subjected to cerebral hypoxia-ischemia in vivo. A chemical screen of {\~{}}5,000 known bioactive compounds revealed that cardiac glycosides, antagonists of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, inhibit autotic cell death in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase $\alpha$1 subunit blocks peptide and starvation-induced autosis in vitro. Thus, we have identified a unique form of autophagy-dependent cell death, a Food and Drug Administration-approved class of compounds that inhibit such death, and a crucial role for Na(+),K(+)-ATPase in its regulation. These findings have implications for understanding how cells die during certain stress conditions and how such cell death might be prevented.},

Altered proteins are usually organised in the form of toxic multimeric complexes that eventually promote neuronal death. Cells rely on surveillance mechanisms that take care of the removal of these toxic products. What then goes wrong in these pathologies? Recent studies have shown that a primary failure in autophagy, a mechanism for clearance of intracellular components in lysosomes, could be responsible for the accumulation of these altered proteins inside the affected neurons. In this Review we summarise our current knowledge on the contribution of autophagy to the maintenance of normal cellular homoeostasis, its changes in neurodegenerative disorders, and the role of aggravating factors such as oxidative stress and ageing on autophagic failure in these pathologies. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Curcumin treatment prevented paraquat-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptotic cell death. Curcumin also exerted a neuroprotective effect by increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic and antioxidant genes. The pretreatment of curcumin significantly decreased gene expression and protein production of amyloid precursor protein. The activation of autophagy process was found defective in paraquat-induced cells, indicated by the accumulation and reduction of LC3I/II. Noteworthy, curcumin restored LC3I/II expression after the pretreatment. Collectively, curcumin demonstrated as a prominent suppressor of ROS, and could reverse autophagy induction in SH-SY5Y cells. The consequences of this were the reduction of APP production and prevention of SH-SY5Y cells from apoptosis.

abstract = {One of the main pathways of lysosomal proteolysis is chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), which represents a selective mechanism for the degradation of specific soluble proteins within lysosomes. Along with the other two lysosomal pathways, macro- and micro-autophagy, CMA contributes to cellular quality control through the removal of damaged or malfunctioning proteins. The two intrinsic characteristics of CMA are the selective targeting and the direct translocation of substrate proteins into the lysosomal lumen, in a fine-tuned manner through the orchestrated action of a chaperone/co-chaperone complex localized both at the cytosol and the lysosomes. Even though CMA was originally identified as a stress-induced pathway, basal CMA activity is detectable in most cell types analyzed so far, including neurons. Additionally, CMA activity declines with age and this may become a major aggravating factor contributing to neurodegeneration. More specifically, it has been suggested that CMA impairment may underlie the accumulation of misfolded/aggregated proteins, such as alpha-synuclein or LRRK2, whose levels or conformations are critical to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. On the other hand, CMA induction might accelerate clearance of pathogenic proteins and promote cell survival, suggesting that CMA represents a viable therapeutic target for the treatment of various proteinopathies. In the current review, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the role of CMA under physiological and pathological conditions of the nervous system and discuss the implications of these findings for therapeutic interventions for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Moreover, evidence indicates that a long " dormant period" of gradual oxidative damage accumulation precedes and actually leads to the seemingly sudden appearance of clinical and pathological AD symptoms, including amyloid-$\beta$ deposition, neurofibrillary tangle formation, metabolic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. These findings provide important insights into the development of potential treatment regimens and even allude to the possibility of a preventative cure. In this review, we elaborate on the dynamic role of oxidative stress in AD and present corresponding treatment strategies that are currently under investigation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The decrease in autophagic activity observed in almost all cells and tissues as organisms age was proposed to contribute to different aspects of the aging phenotype and to the aggravation of detrimental age-related diseases. The recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy and the identification of the subset of genes involved in this process has enabled the use of genetic manipulations to start testing this hypothesis. Here, I review the recent genetic evidence in support of tight connections between autophagy, health span and aging.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent cellular catabolic mechanism mediating the turnover of intracellular organelles and long-lived proteins. Reduction of autophagy activity has been shown to lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in neurons and may be involved in chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. To explore the mechanism of autophagy and identify small molecules that can activate it, we developed a series of high-throughput image-based screens for small-molecule regulators of autophagy. This series of screens allowed us to distinguish compounds that can truly induce autophagic degradation from those that induce the accumulation of autophagosomes as a result of causing cellular damage or blocking downstream lysosomal functions. Our analyses led to the identification of eight compounds that can induce autophagy and promote long-lived protein degradation. Interestingly, seven of eight compounds are FDA-approved drugs for treatment of human diseases. Furthermore, we show that these compounds can reduce the levels of expanded polyglutamine repeats in cultured cells. Our studies suggest the possibility that some of these drugs may be useful for the treatment of Huntington's and other human diseases associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins.},

abstract = {Although autophagy has widely been conceived as a self-destructive mechanism that causes cell death, accumulating evidence suggests that autophagy usually mediates cytoprotection, thereby avoiding the apoptotic or necrotic demise of stressed cells. Recent evidence produced by our groups demonstrates that autophagy is also involved in pharmacological manipulations that increase longevity. Exogenous supply of the polyamine spermidine can prolong the lifespan of (while inducing autophagy in) yeast, nematodes and flies. Similarly, resveratrol can trigger autophagy in cells from different organisms, extend lifespan in nematodes, and ameliorate the fitness of human cells undergoing metabolic stress. These beneficial effects are lost when essential autophagy modulators are genetically or pharmacologically inactivated, indicating that autophagy is required for the cytoprotective and/or anti-aging effects of spermidine and resveratrol. Genetic and functional studies indicate that spermidine inhibits histone acetylases, while resveratrol activates the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 to confer cytoprotection/longevity. Although it remains elusive whether the same histones (or perhaps other nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins) act as the downstream targets of spermidine and resveratrol, these results point to an essential role of protein hypoacetylation in autophagy control and in the regulation of longevity.},

In cultured cells, chaperone-mediated autophagy, which is responsible for the selective degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes, decreases with age. In this work we use lysosomes isolated from rat liver to analyze age-related changes in the levels and activities of the main components of chaperone-mediated autophagy. Lysosomes from "old" (22-month-old) rats show lower rates of chaperone-mediated autophagy, and both substrate binding to the lysosomal membrane and transport into lysosomes decline with age. A progressive age-related decrease in the levels of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a that acts as a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy was responsible for decreased substrate binding in lysosomes from old rats as well as from late passage human fibroblasts. The cytosolic levels and activity of the 73-kDa heat-shock cognate protein required for substrate targeting to lysosomes were unchanged with age. The levels of lysosome-associated hsc73 were increased only in the oldest rats. This increase may be an attempt to compensate for reduced activity of the pathway with age.},

abstract = {Spermine and spermidine are natural polyamines that are produced mainly via decarboxylation of L-ornithine and the sequential transfer of aminopropyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to putrescine by spermidine synthase and spermine synthase. Spermine and spermidine interact with intracellular and extracellular acidic residues of different nature, including nucleic acids, phospholipids, acidic proteins, carboxyl- and sulfate-containing polysaccharides. Therefore, multiple actions have been suggested for these polycations, including modulation of the activity of ionic channels, protein synthesis, protein kinases, and cell proliferation/death, within others. In this review we summarize these neurochemical/neurophysiological/morphological findings, particularly those that have been implicated in the improving and deleterious effects of spermine and spermidine on learning and memory of na{\"{i}}ve animals in shock-motivated and nonshock-motivated tasks, from a historical perspective. The interaction with the opioid system, the facilitation and disruption of morphine-induced reward and the effect of polyamines and putative polyamine antagonists on animal models of cognitive diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Huntington, acute neuroinflammation and brain trauma are also reviewed and discussed. The increased production of polyamines in Alzheimer's disease and the biphasic nature of the effects of polyamines on memory and on the NMDA receptor are also considered. In light of the current literature on polyamines, which include the description of an inborn error of the metabolism characterized by mild-to moderate mental retardation and polyamine metabolism alterations in suicide completers, we can anticipate that polyamine targets may be important for the development of novel strategies and approaches for understanding the etiopathogenesis of important central disorders and their pharmacological treatment.},

Microdialysis was used to introduce 14C-labeled glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glutamate, glutamine, and acetate into the interstitial fluid of the brain to observe their metabolism to 14CO2. Although glucose uptake from the systemic system supplies the carbon source for these compounds, compounds synthesized from glucose by the brain are subject to recycling including complete metabolism to CO2. Therefore, the brain utilizes multiple compounds in its domain to provide the energy needed to fulfill its function. The physiological conditions controlling metabolism and the contribution of compartmentation into different brain regions, cell types, and subcellular spaces are still unresolved. The aconitase inhibitor fluorocitrate, with a lower inhibition threshold in glial cells, was used to identify the proportion of lactate and glucose that was oxidized in glial cells versus neurons. The fluorocitrate data suggest that glial and neuronal cells are capable of utilizing both lactate and glucose for energy metabolism.},

abstract = {Alpha-synuclein is likely to play a role in neurodegenerative processes, including the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons that underlies Parkinson's disease. However, the toxicological properties of alpha-synuclein remain relatively unknown. Here, the relationship between alpha-synuclein expression and neuronal injury was studied in mice exposed to the herbicide paraquat. Paraquat neurotoxicity was compared in control animals versus mice with transgenic expression of human alpha-synuclein driven by the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter. In control mice, paraquat caused both the formation of alpha-synuclein-containing intraneuronal deposits and the degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons, as demonstrated by silver staining and a reduction of the counts of TH-positive and Nissl-stained cells. Mice overexpressing alpha-synuclein, either the human wild-type or the Ala53Thr mutant form of the protein, displayed paraquat-induced protein aggregates but were completely protected against neurodegeneration. These resistant animals were also characterized by increased levels of HSP70, a chaperone protein that has been shown to counteract paraquat toxicity in other experimental models and could therefore contribute to neuroprotection in alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. The results indicate a dissociation between toxicant-induced alpha-synuclein deposition and neurodegeneration. They support a role of alpha-synuclein against toxic insults and suggest that its involvement in human neurodegenerative processes may arise not only from a gain of toxic function, as previously proposed, but also from a loss of defensive properties.},

This interest is further heightened by the demonstration that various autophagic pathways, including macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy, are implicated in the turnover of proteins that are prone to aggregation in cellular or animal disease models. These observations have stimulated new awareness in the pivotal role of the autophagic pathways in neurodegenerative disease pathophysiology, and have sparked extensive research aimed at deciphering the mechanisms by which autophagy is altered in these disorders.

The accumulation of UPS substrates and neuronal toxicity increased with increasing levels of proteasome inhibition.

At advanced geriatric age, this decline is maximal owing to transition from a normal quiescence into an irreversible senescence state. How satellite cells maintain quiescence and avoid senescence until advanced age remains unknown. Here we report that basal autophagy is essential to maintain the stem-cell quiescent state in mice. Failure of autophagy in physiologically aged satellite cells or genetic impairment of autophagy in young cells causes entry into senescence by loss of proteostasis, increased mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, resulting in a decline in the function and number of satellite cells. Re-establishment of autophagy reverses senescence and restores regenerative functions in geriatric satellite cells. As autophagy also declines in human geriatric satellite cells, our findings reveal autophagy to be a decisive stem-cell-fate regulator, with implications for fostering muscle regeneration in sarcopenia.},

abstract = {In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.},

Cell death occurred through apoptosis (type 1 cell death), since it was reduced by stabilization of mitochondrial membranes (with Bcl-2 or vMIA, a cytomegalovirus-derived gene) or by caspase inhibition. Under conditions in which the fusion between lysosomes and autophagosomes was inhibited, the formation of autophagic vacuoles was enhanced at a preapoptotic stage, as indicated by accumulation of LC3-II protein, ultrastructural studies, and an increase in the acidic vacuolar compartment. Cells exhibiting a morphology reminiscent of (autophagic) type 2 cell death, however, recovered, and only cells with a disrupted mitochondrial transmembrane potential were beyond the point of no return and inexorably died even under optimal culture conditions. All together, these data indicate that autophagy may be cytoprotective, at least under conditions of nutrient depletion, and point to an important cross talk between type 1 and type 2 cell death pathways.},

abstract = {Purpose. Gliosis is the response of glial cells within retinal tissue to injury. It can be beneficial in the short term, but if the response is extended it can lead to scar formation, which contributes to blindness. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is considered to be a hallmark event of gliosis, but the factors involved throughout its associated signaling pathway remain poorly understood, particularly in the retina. Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) can inhibit phosphatases, thereby altering the phosphorylation of proteins, this study tested the hypothesis that ROS regulate the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) in gliosis. Methods. Increases in pERK1/2 were detected using Western blotting and immunofluorescence in three models of retinal stress, specifically the in vivo light induction, the rd1 disease, and the ex vivo retinal explant models. Explanted murine retinas were used to identify the signaling partners of pERK1/2 via Western blotting, in conjunction with inhibitors. The effect of this pathway on cell death was measured with terminal dUTP nick end labeling. Results. It was demonstrated that several inhibitors of ROS greatly reduce the levels of pERK1/2 in the somata of M{\"{u}}ller cells and furthermore decrease two other downstream signaling events: the phosphorylation of STAT3 and the upregulation of basic fibroblast growth factor. Using the specific inhibitor of ERK1/2, UO126, the resultant outcomes of this signaling pathway were determined to contribute significantly to cell survival. Conclusions. The novel finding of this study that ROS contribute to a prosurvival signaling pathway in retinal M{\"{u}}ller cell gliosis indicates that some degree of caution should be used when considering antioxidants as therapeutics.},

abstract = {Ultrastructural studies of biopsied cortical tissue from the right frontal lobe of 8 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed that the number of synapses in lamina III of Brodmann's area 9 was significantly decreased when compared with the number in age-matched control brains (n = 9; postmortem time, less than 13 hours). Further decline in synaptic number was seen in age-matched autopsied AD specimens. In the AD brains there was significant enlargement of the mean apposition length, which correlated with degree of synapse loss; as synapse density declined, synapse size increased. The enlargement of synapses, coupled with the decrease in synaptic number, allowed the total synaptic contact area per unit volume to remain stable in the patients who underwent biopsy. In autopsied subjects who had AD, there was no further enlargement of mean synaptic contact area. There was a significant correlation between synapse counts and scores on the Mini-Mental State examination in the patients who underwent biopsy. Lower mental status scores were associated with greater loss of synapses. Choline acetyltransferase activity was significantly decreased in the biopsied group and declined further in the autopsied specimens of AD. There was no relationship between choline acetyltransferase activity and scores on the Mini-Mental State examination or synapse number. There is evidence of neural plasticity in the AD neuropil; synaptic contact size increased in patients who had biopsy and possibly compensated for the numerical loss of synapses. But by end stage of the disease, the ability of the cortex to compensate was exceeded and both synapse number and synaptic contact area declined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Such mutations may impair clearance of autophagy substrates with pathological consequences. Recent studies have also uncovered a direct connection between autophagy and RNA processing, supporting an integrated model connecting several ALS-FTLD associated gene products.

abstract = {Autophagy is believed to be an important process during tumorgenesis, and in recent years it has been shown to be modulated in response to a number of conventional anticancer agents. Furthermore, the development of targeted small molecule inhibitors, such as those to the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, has presented a molecular link between the disruption of this signalling cascade and the process of autophagy. The cellular consequence of stimulating or inhibiting autophagy in cancer cells is not completely understood, so it is important that this process be monitored, along with antiproliferative and apoptotic biomarkers, in the preclinical setting. The field of autophagy is still evolving, and there is a constantly changing set of criteria for the assessment of the process in cells, tissues, and organs. The gold standard technique for analyzing autophagy in mammalian cells remains transmission electron microscopy, which has many limitations and is often difficult to perform on in vivo tissue including human tumor xenografts. In order to monitor autophagy in human tumor xenogaft tissue, we have taken the approach to develop an immunohistochemical (IHC) method for the detection of the autophagosome-associated protein, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), in human tumor xenografts. After synthesis, LC3 is cleaved to form LC3-I, and upon induction of autophagy, LC3-I is conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II, which is tightly bound to the membrane of the autophagosome. It is thought that detection of endogenous LC3-II by IHC could be difficult because of the relatively low level of expression of the protein. Here we present the validation of an IHC method to detect LC3 in human tumor xenografts that we believe is able to distinguish LC3-I from LC3-II. It is hoped that this assay can become a useful tool for the detection of autophagy in preclinical xenograft models and determine the effects of anticancer therapies on the autophagic process.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although there is strong post-mortem and experimental evidence of oxidative damage occurring in AD brains, the use of markers in the peripheral circulation to show oxidative stress is less convincing. We examined plasma from AD patients for markers of increased oxidative stress. We report elevated levels of 4-hydroxy-nonenal (4-HNE) in AD patients compared to controls (median 20.6, IQR 6.0-25.2 vs. 7.8, 3.3-14.5 micomol/l, respectively; p=0.001) but not malondialdehyde (MDA), and lower levels of ascorbate in AD plasma when compared to age-matched controls (9.9, 6.0-33.7 vs. 24.2, 13.9-48.6 micromol/l; p{\textless}0.05). Levels of 4-HNE in AD patients were inversely related to ascorbate (r=-0.337; p=0.07) and Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (r=-0.474; p=0.015). The concentration of protein sulphydryls, free-radical scavengers, was directly related to the MMSE result (r=0.427; p=0.03). Increased production of 4-HNE indicates increased oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation), which is not evident using the more common marker MDA. This elevation of 4-HNE was related to the degree of cognitive impairment (MMSE).},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motoneuron disease with no current effective treatment. Accumulation of abnormal protein inclusions containing SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, among other proteins, is a pathological hallmark of ALS. Autophagy is the major degradation pathway involved in the clearance of damaged organelles and protein aggregates. Although autophagy has been shown to efficiently degrade ALS-linked mutant protein in cell culture models, several studies suggest that autophagy impairment may also contribute to disease pathogenesis. In this report, we tested the potential use of trehalose, a disaccharide that induces MTOR-independent autophagy, in the development of experimental ALS. Administration of trehalose to mutant SOD1 transgenic mice significantly prolonged life span and attenuated the progression of disease signs. These effects were associated with decreased accumulation of SOD1 aggregates and enhanced motoneuron survival. The protective effects of trehalose were associated with increased autophagy levels in motoneurons. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that trehalose led to mutant SOD1 degradation by autophagy in NSC34 motoneuron cells and also protected primary motoneurons against the toxicity of conditioned media from mutant SOD1 transgenic astrocytes. At the mechanistic level, trehalose treatment led to a significant upregulation in the expression of key autophagy-related genes at the mRNA level including Lc3, Becn1, Sqstm1 and Atg5. Consistent with these changes, trehalose administration enhanced the nuclear translocation of FOXO1, an important transcription factor involved in the activation of autophagy in neurons. This study suggests a potential use of trehalose and enhancers of MTOR-independent autophagy for the treatment of ALS.},

abstract = {Autophagy is regulated by posttranslational modifications, including acetylation. Here we show that HLA-B-associated transcript 3 (BAT3) is essential for basal and starvation-induced autophagy in embryonic day 18.5 BAT3(-/-) mouse embryos and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) through the modulation of p300-dependent acetylation of p53 and ATG7. Specifically, BAT3 increases p53 acetylation and proautophagic p53 target gene expression, while limiting p300-dependent acetylation of ATG7, a mechanism known to inhibit autophagy. In the absence of BAT3 or when BAT3 is located exclusively in the cytosol, autophagy is abrogated, ATG7 is hyperacetylated, p53 acetylation is abolished, and p300 accumulates in the cytosol, indicating that BAT3 regulates the nuclear localization of p300. In addition, the interaction between BAT3 and p300 is stronger in the cytosol than in the nucleus and, during starvation, the level of p300 decreases in the cytosol but increases in the nucleus only in the presence of BAT3. We conclude that BAT3 tightly controls autophagy by modulating p300 intracellular localization, affecting the accessibility of p300 to its substrates, p53 and ATG7.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanisms through which aberrant alpha-synuclein (ASYN) leads to neuronal death in Parkinson's disease (PD) are uncertain. In isolated liver lysosomes, mutant ASYNs impair Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA), a targeted lysosomal degradation pathway; however, whether this occurs in a cellular context, and whether it mediates ASYN toxicity, is unknown. We have investigated presently the effects of WT or mutant ASYN on the lysosomal pathways of CMA and macroautophagy in neuronal cells and assessed their impact on ASYN-mediated toxicity.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Novel inducible SH-SY5Y and PC12 cell lines expressing human WT and A53T ASYN, as well as two mutant forms that lack the CMA-targeting motif were generated. Such forms were also expressed in primary cortical neurons, using adenoviral transduction. In each case, effects on long-lived protein degradation, LC3 II levels (as a macroautophagy index), and cell death and survival were assessed. In both PC12 and SH-SY5Y cycling cells, induction of A53T ASYN evoked a significant decrease in lysosomal degradation, largely due to CMA impairment. In neuronally differentiated SH-SH5Y cells, both WT and A53T ASYN induction resulted in gradual toxicity, which was partly dependent on CMA impairment and compensatory macroautophagy induction. In primary neurons both WT and A53T ASYN were toxic, but only in the case of A53T ASYN did CMA dysfunction and compensatory macroautophagy induction occur and participate in death.

CONCLUSIONS: Expression of mutant A53T, and, in some cases, WT ASYN in neuronal cells leads to CMA dysfunction, and this in turn leads to compensatory induction of macroautophagy. Inhibition of these lysosomal effects mitigates ASYN toxicity. Therefore, CMA dysfunction mediates aberrant ASYN toxicity, and may be a target for therapeutic intervention in PD and related disorders. Furthermore, macroautophagy induction in the context of ASYN over-expression, in contrast to other settings, appears to be a detrimental response, leading to neuronal death.},

abstract = {Adult spinal axons do not spontaneously regenerate after injury. However, if the peripheral branch of dorsal root ganglion neurons is lesioned before lesioning the central branch of the same neurons in the dorsal column, these central axons will regenerate and, if cultured, are not inhibited from extending neurites by myelin-associated inhibitors of regeneration such as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). This effect can be mimicked by elevating cAMP and is transcription dependent. The ability of cAMP to overcome inhibition by MAG in culture involves the upregulation of the enzyme arginase I (Arg I) and subsequent increase in synthesis of polyamines such as putrescine. Now we show that a peripheral lesion also induces an increase in Arg I expression and synthesis of polyamines. We also show that the conditioning lesion effect in overcoming inhibition by MAG is initially dependent on ongoing polyamine synthesis but, with time after lesion, becomes independent of ongoing synthesis. However, if synthesis of polyamines is blocked in vivo the early phase of good growth after a conditioning lesion is completely blocked and the later phase of growth, when ongoing polyamine synthesis is not required during culture, is attenuated. We also show that putrescine must be converted to spermidine both in culture and in vivo to overcome inhibition by MAG and that spermidine can promote optic nerve regeneration in vivo. These results suggest that spermidine could be a useful tool in promoting CNS axon regeneration after injury.},

Intrastriatal administration of quinolinic acid (QA) causes neurodegeneration, glial proliferation and cognitive impairment in animals, which are similar to these seen in human HD. Since polyamines improve memory in cognitive tasks, we now tested if the post-training intrastriatal administration of spermine, an agonist of the polyamine site at the NMDA receptor, reverses the deficits in the object recognition task induced by QA. Bilateral striatal injections of QA (180 or 360nmol/site) caused object recognition impairment, neuronal death and reactive astrogliosis. A single injection of spermine (0.1 and 1nmol/site), 5days after QA injection, reversed QA-induced impairment of object recognition task. Spermine (0.1nmol/site) also inhibited QA-induced reactive astrogliosis measured by a semi-quantitative determination of GFAP immunolabelling, but did not alter neuronal death, measured by a semi-quantitative determination of fluoro-Jade C staining. These results suggest that polyamine binding sites may be considered a novel therapeutic target to prevent reactive astrogliosis and mnemonic deficits in HD.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a degradative mechanism involved in the recycling and turnover of cytoplasmic constituents from eukaryotic cells. This phenomenon of autophagy has been observed in neurons from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting a functional role for autophagy in neuronal cell death. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that exposure to pesticides can be a risk factor in the incidence of PD. In this sense, paraquat (PQ) (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride), a widely used herbicide that is structurally similar to the known dopaminergic neurotoxicant MPP(+) (1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridine), has been suggested as a potential etiologic factor for the development of PD. The current study shows, for the first time, that low concentrations of PQ induce several characteristics of autophagy in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In this way, PQ induced the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in the cytoplasm and the recruitment of a LC3-GFP fusion protein to AVs. Furthermore, the cells treated with PQ showed an increase of the long-lived protein degradation which is blocked in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Finally, the cells succumbed to cell death with hallmarks of apoptosis such as phosphatidylserine exposure, caspase activation, and chromatin condensation. While caspase inhibition retarded cell death, autophagy inhibition accelerated the apoptotic cell death induced by PQ. Altogether, these findings show the relationship between autophagy and apoptotic cell death in human neuroblastoma cells treated with PQ.},

abstract = {Spermidine (SPD) is an endogenous aliphatic amine that modulates GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors and improves memory. Recent evidence suggests that systemic SPD improves the persistence of the long term memory of fear. However, the role of hippocampal polyamines and its binding sites in the persistence of fear memory is to be determined, as well as its putative underlying mechanisms. This study investigated whether the intrahippocampal (i.h.) infusion of spermidine or arcaine, modulators of polyamine binding site at GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors, alters the persistence of the memory of contextual fear conditioning task in rats. We also investigated whether protein synthesis and cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) play a role in SPD-induced improvement of the fear memory persistence. While 12h post-training infusion of spermidine facilitated, arcaine and the inhibitor of protein synthesis (anisomycin) impaired the memory of fear assessed 7days after training. The infusion of arcaine, anisomycin or a selective PKA inhibitor (H-89), at doses that have no effect on memory per se, prevented the SPD-induced improvement of memory persistence. H-89 prevented the stimulatory effect of SPD on phospho-PKA/total-PKA ratio. These results suggests that the improvement of fear memory persistence induced by spermidine involves GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors, PKA pathway and protein synthesis in rats.},

abstract = {Autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates is important for cell survival, but it is not known how the autophagic machinery recognizes such aggregates. In this study, we report that polymerization of the polyubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1 yields protein bodies that either reside free in the cytosol and nucleus or occur within autophagosomes and lysosomal structures. Inhibition of autophagy led to an increase in the size and number of p62 bodies and p62 protein levels. The autophagic marker light chain 3 (LC3) colocalized with p62 bodies and co-immunoprecipitated with p62, suggesting that these two proteins participate in the same complexes. The depletion of p62 inhibited recruitment of LC3 to autophagosomes under starvation conditions. Strikingly, p62 and LC3 formed a shell surrounding aggregates of mutant huntingtin. Reduction of p62 protein levels or interference with p62 function significantly increased cell death that was induced by the expression of mutant huntingtin. We suggest that p62 may, via LC3, be involved in linking polyubiquitinated protein aggregates to the autophagy machinery.},

abstract = {Environmental toxicants and, in particular, pesticides have been implicated as risk factors in Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of this study was to determine if selective nigrostriatal degeneration could be reproduced by systemic exposure of mice to the widely used herbicide paraquat. Repeated intraperitoneal paraquat injections killed dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta, as assessed by stereological counting of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive and Nissl-stained neurons. This cell loss was dose- and age-dependent. Several lines of evidence indicated selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to paraquat. The number of GABAergic cells was not decreased in the SN pars reticulata, and counting of Nissl-stained neurons in the hippocampus did not reveal any change in paraquat-treated mice. Degenerating cell bodies were observed by silver staining, but only in the SN pars compacta, and glial response was present in the ventral mesencephalon but not in the frontal cortex and cerebellum. No significant depletion of striatal dopamine followed paraquat administration. On the other hand, enhanced dopamine synthesis was suggested by an increase in TH activity. These findings unequivocally show that selective dopaminergic degeneration, one of the pathological hallmarks of PD, is also a characteristic of paraquat neurotoxicity. The apparent discrepancy between pathological (i.e., neurodegeneration) and neurochemical (i.e., lack of significant dopamine loss) effects represents another important feature of this paraquat model and is probably a reflection of compensatory mechanisms by which neurons that survive damage are capable of restoring neurotransmitter tissue levels. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

The fact that CHX inhibits autophagy has been generally interpreted to indicate that newly synthesized protein is indispensable for autophagy. However, CHX is also known to increase the intracellular level of amino acids and activate mTORC1 activity, a master negative regulator of autophagy. Accordingly, CHX can affect autophagic activity through inhibition of de novo protein synthesis and/or modulation of mTORC1 signaling. In this study, we investigated the effects of CHX on autophagy using specific autophagy markers. We found that CHX inhibited starvation-induced autophagy but not Torin1-induced autophagy. CHX also suppressed starvation-induced puncta formation of GFP-ULK1, an early-step marker of the autophagic process which is regulated by mTORC1. CHX activated mTORC1 even under autophagy-inducible starvation conditions. Finally, the inhibitory effect of CHX on starvation-induced autophagy was cancelled by the mTOR inhibitor Torin1. These results suggest that CHX inhibits starvation-induced autophagy through mTORC1 activation and also that autophagy does not require new protein synthesis at least in the acute phase of starvation.},

Amyloid beta 42 peptide (Ab 1–42) is believed to play a causative role in the development of AD. Here we expressed human Ab 1–42 and amyloid beta 40 (Ab 1–40) in Drosophila neurons. Ab 1–42 but not Ab 1– 40 causes an extensive accumulation of autophagic vesicles that become increasingly dysfunctional with age. Ab 1–42 -induced impairment of the degradative function, as well as the structural integrity, of post-lysosomal autophagic vesicles triggers a neurodegenerative cascade that can be enhanced by autophagy activation or partially rescued by autophagy inhibition. Compromise and leakage from post-lysosomal vesicles result in cytosolic acidification, additional damage to membranes and organelles, and erosive destruction of cytoplasm leading to eventual neuron death. Neuronal autophagy initially appears to play a pro-survival role that changes in an age-dependent way to a pro-death role in the context of Ab 1–42 expression. Our in vivo observations provide a mechanistic understanding for the differential neurotoxicity of Ab 1–42 and Ab 1–40 , and reveal an Ab 1–42 -induced death execution pathway mediated by an age-dependent autophagic-lysosomal injury.},

abstract = {During the process of autophagy, autophagosomes undergo a maturation process consisting of multiple fusions with endosomes and lysosomes, which provide an acidic environment and digestive function to the interior of the autophagosome. Here we found that a fusion protein of monomeric red-fluorescence protein and LC3, the most widely used marker for autophagosomes, exhibits a quite different localization pattern from that of GFP-LC3. GFP-LC3 loses fluorescence due to lysosomal acidic and degradative conditions but mRFP-LC3 does not, indicating that the latter can label the autophagic compartments both before and after fusion with lysosomes. Taking advantage of this property, we devised a novel method for dissecting the maturation process of autophagosomes. mRFP-GFP tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3 (tfLC3) showed a GFP and mRFP signal before the fusion with lysosomes, and exhibited only the mRFP signal subsequently. Using this method, we provided evidence that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Rab7 prevented the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, suggesting that Rab7 is involved in this step. This method will be of general utility for analysis of the autophagosome maturation process.},

abstract = {Increased numbers of autophagosomes/autophagic vacuoles are seen in a variety of physiological and pathological states in the nervous system. In many cases, it is unclear if this phenomenon is the result of increased autophagic activity or decreased autophagosome-lysosome fusion. The functional significance of autophagy and its relationship to cell death in the nervous system is also poorly understood. In this review, we have considered these issues in the context of acute neuronal injury and a range of chronic neurodegenerative conditions, including the Lurcher mouse, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and prion diseases. While many issues remain unresolved, these conditions raise the possibility that autophagy can have either deleterious or protective effects depending on the specific situation and stage in the pathological process.},

abstract = {Genetic variability in the alpha-synuclein gene and long-term exposure to the pesticide paraquat constitute possible risk factors for sporadic Parkinson's disease. The goal of the present study was to further characterize the effects of paraquat in mice as a model of Parkinson's disease and to determine whether it acted synergistically with alpha-synuclein over-expression to cause nigrostriatal cell death or dysfunction. Paraquat (10 mg/kg i.p.) was administered once a week for 3 weeks to mice over-expressing human alpha-synuclein under the Thy1 promoter and their wild-type littermates. The effect of paraquat on catecholaminergic neurons was reminiscent of that of Parkinson's disease, with preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tier of the substantia nigra pars compacta and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase staining in the locus coeruleus. alpha-Synuclein over-expression did not increase paraquat-induced cell loss, and paraquat did not worsen the behavioral deficits observed in the transgenic mice. However, paraquat markedly increased proteinase-K-resistant alpha-synuclein aggregates in substantia nigra of the transgenic mice. The data further validate the use of paraquat to model Parkinson's disease in mice and show that although paraquat and alpha-synuclein over-expression act synergistically to increase protein aggregation in vivo, this interaction does not result in short-term neuroprotection or increased vulnerability of nigrostriatal neurons.},

Essential for neuropathological diagnosis are $\alpha$-synuclein-immunopositive Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies. The pathological process targets specific induction sites: lesions initially occur in the dorsal motor nucleus of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves and anterior olfactory nucleus. Thereafter, less vulnerable nuclear grays and cortical areas gradually become affected. The disease process in the brain stem pursues an ascending course with little interindividual variation. The pathology in the anterior olfactory nucleus makes fewer incursions into related areas than that developing in the brain stem. Cortical involvement ensues, beginning with the anteromedial temporal mesocortex. From there, the neocortex succumbs, commencing with high order sensory association and prefrontal areas. First order sensory association/premotor areas and primary sensory/motor fields then follow suit. This study traces the course of the pathology in incidental and symptomatic Parkinson cases proposing a staging procedure based upon the readily recognizable topographical extent of the lesions. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {Modulating the tau level may represent a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD), as accumulating evidence shows that Abeta-induced neurodegeneration is mediated by tau. It is therefore important to understand the expression and degradation of tau in neurons. Recently we showed that overexpressed mutant tau and tau aggregates are degraded via the autophagic pathway in an N2a cell model. Here we investigated whether autophagy is involved in the degradation of endogenous tau in cultured primary neurons. We activated this pathway in primary neurons with trehalose, an enhancer of autophagy. This resulted in the reduction of endogenous tau protein. Tau phosphorylation at several sites elevated in AD pathology had little influence on its degradation by autophagy. Furthermore, by using a neuronal cell model of tauopathy, we showed that activation of autophagy suppresses tau aggregation and eliminates cytotoxicity. Notably, apart from activating autophagy, trehalose also inhibits tau aggregation directly. Thus, trehalose may be a good candidate for developing therapeutic strategies for AD and other tauopathies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Autophagy plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been reported that autophagic flux is altered in patients with AD, and application of the autophagy enhancer rapamycin may alleviate the cognitive impairment and amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) neuropathology in transgenic animal model of AD. Since rapamycin is also an immune suppressor, there is a concern that long-term use of rapamycin may bring severe unwanted side effects. The aim of this study is to test if carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-epileptic drug that has a potent autophagy enhancement effect, has anti-AD effects in APP(swe)/PS1(deltaE9) transgenic mice model of AD. We found that APP(swe)/PS1(deltaE9) mice display increased autophagic activity accompanied by decreased mTOR activity. After three months treatment with CBZ in the APP(swe)/PS1(deltaE9) mice, we demonstrated that the spatial learning and memory deficits in these mice are significantly alleviated. We also documented that the cerebral amyloid plaque burden and A$\beta$42 levels in these mice are significantly reduced. Furthermore, we showed that CBZ significantly enhances the autophagic flux in the APP(swe)/PS1(deltaE9) mice which is unlikely via mTOR-dependent autophagy pathway. These data suggest that long-term CBZ treatment may have a protective effect in AD mouse model possibly through enhancing the autophagic flux.},

Akt/PKB activation blocks FoxO3 activation and autophagy, and this effect is not prevented by rapamycin. FoxO3 controls the transcription of autophagy-related genes, including LC3 and Bnip3, and Bnip3 appears to mediate the effect of FoxO3 on autophagy. This effect is not prevented by proteasome inhibitors. Thus, FoxO3 controls the two major systems of protein breakdown in skeletal muscle, the ubiquitin-proteasomal and autophagic/lysosomal pathways, independently. These findings point to FoxO3 and Bnip3 as potential therapeutic targets in muscle wasting disorders and other degenerative and neoplastic diseases in which autophagy is involved.},

While we cannot live without it, it was perceived as a bane to aerobic organisms due to the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen metabolites by mitochondria and other cellular compartments. However, this dogma was challenged when these species were demonstrated to modulate cellular responses through altering signaling pathways. In fact, since this discovery of a dichotomous role of reactive species in immune function and signal transduction, research in this field grew at an exponential pace and the pursuit for mechanisms involved began. Due to a significant number of review articles present on the reactive species mediated cell death, we have focused on emerging novel pathways such as autophagy, signaling and maintenance of the mitochondrial network. Despite its role in several processes, increased reactive species generation has been associated with the origin and pathogenesis of a plethora of diseases. While it is tempting to speculate that anti-oxidant therapy would protect against these disorders, growing evidence suggests that this may not be true. This further supports our belief that these reactive species play a fundamental role in maintenance of cellular and tissue homeostasis.},

abstract = {Autophagy is an essential, fundamentally important catabolic pathway in which double membrane-bound vesicles form in the cytosol and encircle macromolecules and organelles to permit their degradation after fusion with lysosomes. More than a decade of research has revealed that autophagy is required for normal central nervous system (CNS) function and plays a central role in maintaining protein and organelle quality controls in neurons. Neurodegenerative diseases occur when misfolded proteins accumulate and disrupt normal cellular processes, and autophagy has emerged as a key arbiter of the cell's homeostatic response to this threat. One class of inherited neurodegenerative disease is known as the CAG/polyglutamine repeat disorders, and these diseases all result from the expansion of a CAG repeat tract in the coding regions of distinct genes. Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat diseases result in the production polyQ-expanded proteins that misfold to form inclusions or aggregates that challenge the main cellular proteostasis system of the cell, the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). The UPS cannot efficiently degrade polyQ-expanded disease proteins, and components of the UPS are enriched in polyQ disease aggregate bodies found in degenerating neurons. In addition to components of the UPS, polyQ protein cytosolic aggregates co-localize with key autophagy proteins, even in autophagy deficient cells, suggesting that they probably do not reflect the formation of autophagosomes but rather the sequestration of key autophagy components. Furthermore, recent evidence now implicates polyQ proteins in the regulation of the autophagy pathway itself. Thus, a complex model emerges where polyQ proteins play a dual role as both autophagy substrates and autophagy offenders. In this review, we consider the role of autophagy in polyQ disorders and the therapeutic potential for autophagy modulation in these diseases.

Here, we report the generation of isogenic pairs of NPC patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). We observed decreased cell viability, cholesterol accumulation, and dysfunctional autophagic flux in NPC1-deficient human hepatic and neural cells. Genetic correction of a disease-causing mutation rescued these defects and directly linked NPC1 protein function to impaired cholesterol metabolism and autophagy. Screening for autophagy-inducing compounds in disease-affected human cells showed cell type specificity. Carbamazepine was found to be cytoprotective and effective in restoring the autophagy defects in both NPC1-deficient hepatic and neuronal cells and therefore may be a promising treatment option with overall benefit for NPC disease. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Dysregulation of autophagy, a cellular catabolic mechanism essential for degradation of misfolded proteins, has been implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms that lead to the autophagy dysfunction are still not clear. Based on the results of a genome-wide screen, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as common mediators upstream of the activation of the type III PI3 kinase, which is critical for the initiation of autophagy. Furthermore, ROS play an essential function in the induction of the type III PI3 kinase and autophagy in response to amyloid beta peptide, the main pathogenic mediator of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, lysosomal blockage also caused by Abeta is independent of ROS. In addition, we demonstrate that autophagy is transcriptionally down-regulated during normal aging in the human brain. Strikingly, in contrast to normal aging, we observe transcriptional up-regulation of autophagy in the brains of AD patients, suggesting that there might be a compensatory regulation of autophagy. Interestingly, we show that an AD drug and an AD drug candidate have inhibitory effects on autophagy, raising the possibility that decreasing input into the lysosomal system may help to reduce cellular stress in AD. Finally, we provide a list of candidate drug targets that can be used to safely modulate levels of autophagy without causing cell death.},

abstract = {Mitochondria were first postulated to contribute to aging more than 40 years ago. During the following decades, multiple lines of evidence in model organisms and humans showed that impaired mitochondrial function can contribute to age-associated disease phenotypes and aging. However, in contrast to the original theory favoring oxidative damage as a cause for mtDNA mutations, there are now strong data arguing that most mammalian mtDNA mutations originate as replication errors made by the mtDNA polymerase. Currently, a substantial amount of mitochondrial research is focused on finding ways to either remove or counteract the effects of mtDNA mutations with the hope of extending the human health- and lifespan. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the formation of mtDNA mutations and their impact on mitochondrial function. We also critically discuss proposed pathways interlinked with mammalian mtDNA mutations and suggest future research strategies to elucidate the role of mtDNA mutations in aging.},

abstract = {Autophagy is the bulk degradation of proteins and organelles, a process essential for cellular maintenance, cell viability, differentiation and development in mammals. Autophagy has significant associations with neurodegenerative diseases, cardiomyopathies, cancer, programmed cell death, and bacterial and viral infections. During autophagy, a cup-shaped structure, the preautophagosome, engulfs cytosolic components, including organelles, and closes, forming an autophagosome, which subsequently fuses with a lysosome, leading to the proteolytic degradation of internal components of the autophagosome by lysosomal lytic enzymes. During the formation of mammalian autophagosomes, two ubiquitylation-like modifications are required, Atg12-conjugation and LC3-modification. LC3 is an autophagosomal ortholog of yeast Atg8. A lipidated form of LC3, LC3-II, has been shown to be an autophagosomal marker in mammals, and has been used to study autophagy in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases, tumorigenesis, and bacterial and viral infections. The other Atg8 homologues, GABARAP and GATE-16, are also modified by the same mechanism. In non-starved rats, the tissue distribution of LC3-II differs from those of the lipidated forms of GABARAP and GATE-16, GABARAP-II and GATE-16-II, suggesting that there is a functional divergence among these three modified proteins. Delipidation of LC3-II and GABARAP-II is mediated by hAtg4B. We review the molecular mechanism of LC3-modification, the crosstalk between LC3-modification and mammalian Atg12-conjugation, and the cycle of LC3-lipidation and delipidation mediated by hAtg4B, as well as recent findings concerning the other two Atg8 homologues, GABARAP and GATE-16. We also highlight recent findings regarding the pathobiology of LC3-modification, including its role in microbial infection, cancer and neuromuscular diseases.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative process which recycles cellular waste and eliminates potentially toxic damaged organelles and protein aggregates. The important cytoprotective functions of autophagy are demonstrated by the diverse pathogenic consequences that may stem from autophagy dysregulation in a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders. In many of the diseases associated with autophagy anomalies, it is the final stage of autophagy-lysosomal degradation that is disrupted. In several disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), defective lysosomal acidification contributes to this proteolytic failure. The complex regulation of lysosomal pH makes this process vulnerable to disruption by many factors, and reliable lysosomal pH measurements have become increasingly important in investigations of disease mechanisms. Although various reagents for pH quantification have been developed over several decades, they are not all equally well suited for measuring the pH of lysosomes. Here, we evaluate the most commonly used pH probes for sensitivity and localisation, and identify LysoSensor yellow/blue-dextran, among currently used probes, as having the optimal profile of properties for measuring lysosomal pH. In addition, we review evidence that lysosomal acidification is defective in AD and extend our original findings, of elevated lysosomal pH in presenilin 1 (PS1)-deficient blastocysts and neurons, to additional cell models of PS1 and PS1/2 deficiency, to fibroblasts from AD patients with PS1 mutations, and to neurons in the PS/APP mouse model of AD.},

abstract = {Polyamines (spermine and spermidine) play many important roles in cellular function and are supplied from the intestinal lumen. We have shown that continuous high polyamine intake inhibits age-associated pathologies in mice. The mechanism by which polyamines elicit these effects was examined. Twenty-four week old Jc1:ICR male mice were fed one of three experimental chows containing different polyamine concentrations. Lifetime intake of high polyamine chow, which had a polyamine content approximately three times higher than regular chow, elevated polyamine concentrations in whole blood, suppressed age-associated increases in pro-inflammatory status, decreased age-associated pathological changes, inhibited age-associated global alteration in DNA methylation status and reduced the mortality in aged mice. Exogenous spermine augmented DNA methyltransferase activity in Jurkat and HT-29 cells and inhibited polyamine deficiency-induced global alteration in DNA methylation status in vitro. In addition, increased polyamine intake was associated with a decreased incidence of colon tumors in BALB/c mice after 1,2-demethylhydrazine administration; 12 mice (60{\%}) in the low polyamine group developed tumors, compared with only 5 mice (25{\%}) in the high polyamine group (Fisher's exact probability = 0.027, p = 0.025). However, increased polyamine intake accelerated the growth of established tumors; maximal tumor diameter in the Low and High groups was 3.85±0.90 mm and 5.50±1.93 mm, respectively (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.039). Spermine seems to play important roles in inhibiting age-associated and polyamine-deficient induced abnormal gene methylation as well as pathological changes including tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {Biological tissues require oxygen to meet their energetic demands. However, the consumption of oxygen also results in the generation of free radicals that may have damaging effects on cells. The brain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of reactive oxygen species due to its high demand for oxygen, and its abundance of highly peroxidisable substrates. Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance in the redox state of the cell, either by overproduction of reactive oxygen species, or by dysfunction of the antioxidant systems. Oxidative stress has been detected in a range of neurodegenerative disease, and emerging evidence from in vitro and in vivo disease models suggests that oxidative stress may play a role in disease pathogenesis. However, the promise of antioxidants as novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases has not been borne out in clinical studies. In this review, we critically assess the hypothesis that oxidative stress is a crucial player in common neurodegenerative disease and discuss the source of free radicals in such diseases. Furthermore, we examine the issues surrounding the failure to translate this hypothesis into an effective clinical treatment.},

Although high levels of astrocyte-secreted glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) in the CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been reported, the levels of GFAP in the CSF have not been fully investigated in other neurological disorders that cause dementia, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). In this study, we determined the levels of GFAP in the CSF of healthy control (HC) subjects and AD, DLB, and FTLD patients to address two questions: (i) Do the levels of GFAP differ among these disorders? and (ii) Can GFAP be used as a biomarker for the differential diagnosis of these neurodegenerative disorders? The levels of GFAP in AD, DLB, and FTLD patients were significantly higher than those in the HC subjects. Although the levels of GFAP were not significantly different between AD and DLB patients, a higher level of GFAP was observed in FTLD patients than in AD and DLB patients. It is concluded that representative neurological disorders causing dementia were associated with higher levels of GFAP in the CSF. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Autophagy and apoptosis are basic physiologic processes contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Autophagy encompasses pathways that target long-lived cytosolic proteins and damaged organelles. It involves a sequential set of events including double membrane formation, elongation, vesicle maturation and finally delivery of the targeted materials to the lysosome. Apoptotic cell death is best described through its morphology. It is characterized by cell rounding, membrane blebbing, cytoskeletal collapse, cytoplasmic condensation, and fragmentation, nuclear pyknosis, chromatin condensation/fragmentation, and formation of membrane-enveloped apoptotic bodies, that are rapidly phagocytosed by macrophages or neighboring cells. Neurodegenerative disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent, especially in the Western societies, with larger percentage of members living to an older age. They have to be seen not only as a health problem, but since they are care-intensive, they also carry a significant economic burden. Deregulation of autophagy plays a pivotal role in the etiology and/or progress of many of these diseases. Herein, we briefly review the latest findings that indicate the involvement of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases. We provide a brief introduction to autophagy and apoptosis pathways focusing on the role of mitochondria and lysosomes. We then briefly highlight pathophysiology of common neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's diseases, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Then, we describe functions of autophagy and apoptosis in brain homeostasis, especially in the context of the aforementioned disorders. Finally, we discuss different ways that autophagy and apoptosis modulation may be employed for therapeutic intervention during the maintenance of neurodegenerative disorders. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a major clearance route for intracellular aggregate-prone proteins causing diseases such as Huntington's disease. Autophagy induction with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin accelerates clearance of these toxic substrates. As rapamycin has nontrivial side effects, we screened FDA-approved drugs to identify new autophagy-inducing pathways. We found that L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists, the K+ATP channel opener minoxidil, and the G(i) signaling activator clonidine induce autophagy. These drugs revealed a cyclical mTOR-independent pathway regulating autophagy, in which cAMP regulates IP3 levels, influencing calpain activity, which completes the cycle by cleaving and activating G(s)alpha, which regulates cAMP levels. This pathway has numerous potential points where autophagy can be induced, and we provide proof of principle for therapeutic relevance in Huntington's disease using mammalian cell, fly and zebrafish models. Our data also suggest that insults that elevate intracytosolic Ca2+ (like excitotoxicity) inhibit autophagy, thus retarding clearance of aggregate-prone proteins.},

abstract = {Macroautophagy, a major pathway for organelle and protein turnover, has been implicated in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The basis for the profuse accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) in affected neurons of the AD brain, however, is unknown. In this study, we show that constitutive macroautophagy in primary cortical neurons is highly efficient, because newly formed autophagosomes are rapidly cleared by fusion with lysosomes, accounting for their scarcity in the healthy brain. Even after macroautophagy is strongly induced by suppressing mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) kinase activity with rapamycin or nutrient deprivation, active cathepsin-positive autolysosomes rather than LC3-II-positive autophagosomes predominate, implying efficient autophagosome clearance in healthy neurons. In contrast, selectively impeding late steps in macroautophagy by inhibiting cathepsin-mediated proteolysis within autolysosomes with cysteine- and aspartyl-protease inhibitors caused a marked accumulation of electron-dense double-membrane-limited AVs, containing cathepsin D and incompletely degraded LC3-II in perikarya and neurites. Similar structures accumulated in large numbers when fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes was slowed by disrupting their transport on microtubules with vinblastine. Finally, we find that the autophagic vacuoles accumulating after protease inhibition or prolonged vinblastine treatment strongly resembled AVs that collect in dystrophic neurites in the AD brain and in an AD mouse model. We conclude that macroautophagy is constitutively active and highly efficient in healthy neurons and that the autophagic pathology observed in AD most likely arises from impaired clearance of AVs rather than strong autophagy induction alone. Therapeutic modulation of autophagy in AD may, therefore, require targeting late steps in the autophagic pathway.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Several lines of evidence strongly implicate mitochondrial dysfunction as a major causative factor in PD, although the molecular mechanisms responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction are poorly understood. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in the parkin gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-protein ligase, were found to underlie a familial form of PD known as autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP). To gain insight into the molecular mechanism responsible for selective cell death in AR-JP, we have created a Drosophila model of this disorder. Drosophila parkin null mutants exhibit reduced lifespan, locomotor defects, and male sterility. The locomotor defects derive from apoptotic cell death of muscle subsets, whereas the male sterile phenotype derives from a spermatid individualization defect at a late stage of spermatogenesis. Mitochondrial pathology is the earliest manifestation of muscle degeneration and a prominent characteristic of individualizing spermatids in parkin mutants. These results indicate that the tissue-specific phenotypes observed in Drosophila parkin mutants result from mitochondrial dysfunction and raise the possibility that similar mitochondrial impairment triggers the selective cell loss observed in AR-JP.},

It functions in the clearance of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, as well as recycling of cytosolic components during starvation to compensate for nutrient deprivation. This process is regulated by mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)-dependent and mTOR-independent pathways that are amenable to chemical perturbations. Several small molecules modulating autophagy have been identified that have potential therapeutic application in diverse human diseases, including neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration-associated aggregation-prone proteins are predominantly degraded by autophagy and therefore stimulating this process with chemical inducers is beneficial in a wide range of transgenic disease models. Emerging evidence indicates that compromised autophagy contributes to the aetiology of various neurodegenerative diseases related to protein conformational disorders by causing the accumulation of mutant proteins and cellular toxicity. Combining the knowledge of autophagy dysfunction and the mechanism of drug action may thus be rational for designing targeted therapy. The present review describes the cellular signalling pathways regulating mammalian autophagy and highlights the potential therapeutic application of autophagy inducers in neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {Since its introduction 16 years ago, the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) model has profoundly modified our understanding of neuroenergetics by bringing a cellular and molecular resolution. Praised or disputed, the concept has never ceased to attract attention, leading to critical advances and unexpected insights. Here, we summarize recent experimental evidence further supporting the main tenets of the model. Thus, evidence for distinct metabolic phenotypes between neurons (mainly oxidative) and astrocytes (mainly glycolytic) have been provided by genomics and classical metabolic approaches. Moreover, it has become clear that astrocytes act as a syncytium to distribute energy substrates such as lactate to active neurones. Glycogen, the main energy reserve located in astrocytes, is used as a lactate source to sustain glutamatergic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Lactate is also emerging as a neuroprotective agent as well as a key signal to regulate blood flow. Characterization of monocarboxylate transporter regulation indicates a possible involvement in synaptic plasticity and memory. Finally, several modeling studies captured the implications of such findings for many brain functions. The ANLS model now represents a useful, experimentally based framework to better understand the coupling between neuronal activity and energetics as it relates to neuronal plasticity, neurodegeneration, and functional brain imaging.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution of super-resolution light microscopy has narrowed the gap between light and electron microscopy, allowing the imaging of molecules and cellular structures at high resolution within their normal cellular and tissue context. Multimodal imaging approaches such as correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) combine these techniques to create a tool with unique imaging capacity. However, these approaches are typically reserved for specialists, and their application to the analysis of neural tissue is challenging. Here we present SuperCLEM, a relatively simple approach that combines super-resolution fluorescence light microscopy (FLM), 3D electron microscopy (3D-EM) and rendering into 3D models. We demonstrate our workflow using neuron-glia cultures from which we first acquire high-resolution fluorescent light images of myelinated axons. After resin embedding and re-identification of the region of interest, serially aligned EM sections are acquired and imaged using a serial block face scanning electron microscope (SBF-SEM). The FLM and 3D-EM data sets are then combined to render 3D models of the myelinated axons. Thus, the SuperCLEM imaging pipeline is a useful new tool for researchers pursuing similar questions in neuronal, as well as other complex tissue culture systems.},

abstract = {Inherited variants in multiple different genes are associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In many of these genes, the inherited variants alter some aspect of the production or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid $\beta$-peptide (A$\beta$). Thus missense, splice site or duplication mutants in the presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) or the amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes, which alter the levels or shift the balance of A$\beta$ produced, are associated with rare, highly penetrant autosomal dominant forms of Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD). Similarly, the more prevalent late-onset forms of AD are associated with both coding and non-coding variants in genes such as SORL1, PICALM and ABCA7 that affect the production and clearance of A$\beta$. This review summarises some of the recent molecular and structural work on the role of these genes and the proteins coded by them in the biology of A$\beta$. We also briefly outline how the emerging knowledge about the pathways involved in A$\beta$ generation and clearance can be potentially targeted therapeutically.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Escalating numbers of people are experiencing dementia in many countries. With increasing consumer needs, there is anticipated growth in the numbers of people providing diagnostic evaluations, treatments, and care. Ensuring a consistent and contemporary understanding of dementia across all of these groups has become a critical issue. This study aimed to reach consensus among dementia experts from English speaking countries regarding essential and contemporary knowledge about dementia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: An online Delphi study was conducted to examine expert opinion concerning dementia knowledge with three rounds of data collection. A sample of dementia experts was selected by a panel of Australian experts, including a geriatrician and three professors of aged care. Purposive selection was initially undertaken with the sample expanded through snowballing. Dementia experts (N = 19) included geriatricians, psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists, dementia advocates, and nurse academics from the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia. In the first round, these participants provided open-ended responses to questions determining what comprised essential knowledge about dementia. In the second round, responses were summarised into 66 discrete statements that participants rated on the basis of importance. In the third round, a rank-ordered list of the 66 statements and a group median were provided and participants rated the statements again. The degree of consensus regarding importance ratings was determined by assessing median, interquartile range, and proportion of experts scoring above predetermined thresholds. Correlation scores were calculated for each statement after the final round to identify changes in statement scores.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The Delphi experts identified 36 statements about dementia that they considered essential to understanding the condition. Statements about care for a person experiencing dementia and their care giver represented the largest response category. Other statements, for which full or very high consensus was reached, related to dementia characteristics, symptoms and progression, diagnosis and assessment, and treatment and prevention.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results summarise knowledge of dementia that is considered essential across expert representatives of key stakeholder groups from three countries. This information has implications for the delivery of care to people with the condition and the development of dementia education programs.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's (Lewy body) disease, the most widespread degenerative illnesses of the human brain, involve multiple neuronal systems and are the consequences of changes in the neuronal cytoskeleton, which develop in only a few susceptible types of nerve cells. In Alzheimer's disease, affected neurons produce neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, while in Parkinson's disease they develop Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. In both illnesses a specific pattern of lesions evolves slowly over time and remains remarkably consistent across cases. In Alzheimer's disease, six developmental stages can be distinguished, reflecting the predictable manner in which the neurofibrillary changes spread through the telencephalic cortex. In stages I and II, the pathological process makes inroads into the transentorhinal and entorhinal regions; thereafter, in stages III and IV, it proceeds into the adjoining cortical and subcortical components of the limbic system. Eventually, in stages V and VI, the devastation engulfs association areas of the neocortex. In Parkinson's disease lesions also impair portions of the limbic system. The predilection sites include the transentorhinal and entorhinal regions, the CA2 sector of the Ammon's horn, the limbic thalamic nuclei, the anterior cingulated areas, agranular insular cortex, and components of the amygdala. In addition, non-thalamic nuclei with diffuse projections to the telencephalic cortex and centres that regulate endocrine and autonomic functions exhibit severe lesions.},

abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is one of nine known conditions caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion that is translated into a polyglutamine tract in the disease protein. Genetic and transgenic data suggest that the primary effect of these CAG/polyglutamine expansions is to confer a toxic gain-of-function on the mutant protein. The cellular pathology of all known polyglutamine diseases is characterised by the accumulation of the relevant mutant protein along with other proteins in aggregates (also known as inclusions) in neurons in the disease brain. Such aggregates are seen in neuronal nuclei and processes in HD. The role of aggregates in these diseases has been a subject of vigorous debate. However, irrespective of the nature(s) of the toxic species of huntingtin, it is desirable for cells to be able to control the levels of these toxic proteins and restrict their accumulation. In this paper we will review the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome routes for protein degradation and how they may be involved in the clearance of aggregate-prone proteins, exemplified by mutant huntingtin exon 1. We will also consider the possibilities that these protein degradation pathways may be perturbed as a consequence of the mutations that form the aggregate-prone proteins. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {At birth the trans-placental nutrient supply is suddenly interrupted, and neonates face severe starvation until supply can be restored through milk nutrients. Here, we show that neonates adapt to this adverse circumstance by inducing autophagy. Autophagy is the primary means for the degradation of cytoplasmic constituents within lysosomes. The level of autophagy in mice remains low during embryogenesis; however, autophagy is immediately upregulated in various tissues after birth and is maintained at high levels for 3-12 h before returning to basal levels within 1-2 days. Mice deficient for Atg5, which is essential for autophagosome formation, appear almost normal at birth but die within 1 day of delivery. The survival time of starved Atg5-deficient neonates (approximately 12 h) is much shorter than that of wild-type mice (approximately 21 h) but can be prolonged by forced milk feeding. Atg5-deficient neonates exhibit reduced amino acid concentrations in plasma and tissues, and display signs of energy depletion. These results suggest that the production of amino acids by autophagic degradation of 'self' proteins, which allows for the maintenance of energy homeostasis, is important for survival during neonatal starvation.},

abstract = {High-resolution imaging of autophagy has been used intensively in cell culture studies, but so far it has been difficult to visualize this process in detail in whole animal models. In this study we present a versatile method for high-resolution imaging of microbial infection in zebrafish larvae by injecting pathogens into the tail fin. This allows visualization of autophagic compartments by light and electron microscopy, which makes it possible to correlate images acquired by the 2 techniques. Using this method we have studied the autophagy response against Mycobacterium marinum infection. We show that mycobacteria during the progress of infection are frequently associated with GFP-Lc3-positive vesicles, and that 2 types of GFP-Lc3-positive vesicles were observed. The majority of these vesicles were approximately 1 $\mu$m in size and in close vicinity of bacteria, and a smaller number of GFP-Lc3-positive vesicles was larger in size and were observed to contain bacteria. Quantitative data showed that these larger vesicles occurred significantly more in leukocytes than in other cell types, and that approximately 70{\%} of these vesicles were positive for a lysosomal marker. Using electron microscopy, it was found that approximately 5{\%} of intracellular bacteria were present in autophagic vacuoles and that the remaining intracellular bacteria were present in phagosomes, lysosomes, free inside the cytoplasm or occurred as large aggregates. Based on correlation of light and electron microscopy images, it was shown that GFP-Lc3-positive vesicles displayed autophagic morphology. This study provides a new approach for injection of pathogens into the tail fin, which allows combined light and electron microscopy imaging in vivo and opens new research directions for studying autophagy process related to infectious diseases. {\textcopyright} 2014 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a major catabolic pathway in eukaryotic cells whereby the lack of amino acids induces the formation of autophagosomes, double-bilayer membrane vesicles that mediate delivery of cytosolic proteins and organelles for lysosomal degradation. The biogenesis and turnover of autophagosomes in mammalian cells as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying induction of autophagy and trafficking of these vesicles are poorly understood. Here we utilized different autophagic markers to determine the involvement of microtubules in the autophagic process. We show that autophagosomes associate with microtubules and concentrate near the microtubule-organizing center. Moreover, we demonstrate that autophagosomes, but not phagophores, move along these tracks en route for degradation. Disruption of microtubules leads to a significant reduction in the number of mature autophagosomes but does not affect their life span or their fusion with lysosomes. We propose that microtubules serve to deliver only mature autophagosomes for degradation, thus providing a spatial barrier between phagophores and lysosomes.},

In this study, we explored the effects of rapamycin in combination with either tacrolimus or cyclosporine on lymphocyte proliferation, and expression of interleulin-2 (IL-2) and TGF-beta METHODS Peripheral blood mononuclear cells/lymphocytes were isolated from buffy coats obtained from blood center, and activated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in the presence or absence of rapamycin, cyclo sporine, and tacrolimus alone or in various combinations. The activation was quantified by 3H-thymidine uptake assay and using reverse transcriptase assisted polymerase chain reaction and ELISA, we studied the TGF-beta and IL-2 mRNA and protein expression, respectively. RESULTS In this study, we report that rapamycin in combination with either tacrolimus or cyclosporine significantly inhibited the lymphocyte proliferation, IL-2 expression, and induced TGF-beta, compared with these drugs alone. The levels of TGF-beta and IL-2 correlated positively and negatively, respectively, with inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation. CONCLUSIONS These novel findings provide the mechanism as well as the rationale to use these drugs in combination at subclinical dosages in organ transplantation.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress is associated with normal aging and several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we quantified multiple oxidized bases in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes and cerebellum from short postmortem interval AD brain and age-matched control subjects using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with selective ion monitoring (GC/MS-SIM) and stable labeled internal standards. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA were extracted from eight AD and eight age-matched control subjects. We found that levels of multiple oxidized bases in AD brain specimens were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) higher in frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes compared to control subjects and that mitochondrial DNA had approximately 10-fold higher levels of oxidized bases than nuclear DNA. These data are consistent with higher levels of oxidative stress in mitochondria. Eight-hydroxyguanine, a widely studied biomarker of DNA damage, was approximately 10-fold higher than other oxidized base adducts in both AD and control subjects. DNA from temporal lobe showed the most oxidative damage, whereas cerebellum was only slightly affected in AD brains. These results suggest that oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA may contribute to the neurodegeneration of AD.},

Since their conception a little over a decade ago, these techniques have quickly become the method of choice for many biologists studying structures and processes of single cells at the nanoscale. In this review, we present the three main approaches used to tackle the diffraction barrier of ∼200 nm: stimulated-emission depletion (STED) microscopy, structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We first present a theoretical overview of the techniques and underlying physics, followed by a practical guide to all of the facets involved in designing a super-resolution experiment, including an approachable explanation of the photochemistry involved, labeling methods available, and sample preparation procedures. Finally, we highlight some of the most exciting recent applications of and developments in these techniques, and discuss the outlook for this field.

abstract = {Mitochondria are well known for their central roles in ATP production, calcium homeostasis, and heme and steroid biosynthesis. However, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, once thought to be toxic byproducts of mitochondrial physiologic activities, have recently been recognized as important cell-signaling molecules in the vascular endothelium, where their production, conversion, and destruction are highly regulated. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species appear to regulate important vascular homeostatic functions under basal conditions in a variety of vascular beds, where, in particular, they contribute to endothelium-dependent vasodilation. On exposure to cardiovascular risk factors, endothelial mitochondria produce excessive ROS in concert with other cellular ROS sources. Mitochondrial ROS, in this setting, act as important signaling molecules activating prothrombotic and proinflammatory pathways in the vascular endothelium, a process that initially manifests itself as endothelial dysfunction and, if persistent, may lead to the development of atherosclerotic plaques. This review concentrates on emerging appreciation of the importance of mitochondrial ROS as cell-signaling molecules in the vascular endothelium under both physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. Future potential avenues of research in this field also are discussed.},

abstract = {Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases, sporadic or familial, mainly characterized by dementia and parkinsonism associated to atrophy of the frontotemporal cortex and the basal ganglia, with deposition of abnormal tau in brain. Hereditary tauopathies are related with mutations of the tau gene. Up to the present, these diseases have not been helped by any disease-modifying treatment, and patients die a few years after the onset of symptoms.We have developed and characterized a mouse model of tauopathy with parkinsonism, overexpressing human mutated tau protein with deletion of parkin (PK-/-/TauVLW). At 3months of age, these mice present abnormal dopamine-related behavior, severe dropout of dopamine neurons in the ventral midbrain, reduced dopamine levels in the striatum and abundant phosphorylated tau-positive neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, astrogliosis, and, at 12months old, plaques of murine ??-amyloid in the hippocampus.Trehalose is a natural disaccharide that increases the removal of abnormal proteins through enhancement of autophagy. In this work, we tested if 1{\%} trehalose in the drinking water reverts the PK-/-/TauVLW phenotype. The treatment with trehalose of 3-month-old PK-/-/TauVLW mice for 2.5months reverted the dropout of dopamine neurons, which takes place in the ventral midbrain of vehicle treated PK-/-/TauVLW and the reduced dopamine-related proteins levels in the midbrain and striatum. The number of phosphorylated tau-positive neuritic plaques and the levels of phosphorylated tau decreased, as well as astrogliosis in brain regions. The autophagy markers in the brain, the autophagic vacuoles isolated from the liver, and the electron microscopy data indicate that these effects of trehalose are mediated by autophagy. The treatment with trehalose for 4months of 3-month-old PK-/-/TauVLW mice maintained the amelioration of the tau pathology and astrogliosis but failed to revert DA-related pathology in the striatum. Furthermore, the 3-week treatment with trehalose of 14-month-old PK-/-/TauVLW mice, at the limit of their life expectancy, improved the motor behavior and anxiety of these animals, and reduced their levels of phosphorylated tau and the number of murine ??-amyloid plaques.Trehalose is neuroprotective in this model of tauopathy. Since trehalose is free of toxic effects at high concentrations, this study opens the way for clinical studies of the effects of trehalose in human tauopathies. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Autophagy, a major degradative pathway for proteins and organelles, is essential for survival of mature neurons. Extensive autophagic-lysosomal pathology in Alzheimer's disease brain contributes to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we identified and characterized marked intraneuronal amyloid-b peptide/ amyloid and lysosomal system pathology in the Alzheimer's disease mouse model TgCRND8 similar to that previously described in Alzheimer's disease brains. We further establish that the basis for these pathologies involves defective proteolytic clearance of neuronal autophagic substrates including amyloid-b peptide. To establish the pathogenic significance of these abnormalities, we enhanced lysosomal cathepsin activities and rates of autophagic protein turnover in TgCRND8 mice by genetically deleting cystatin B, an endogenous inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases. Cystatin B deletion rescued autophagic-lysosomal path-ology, reduced abnormal accumulations of amyloid-b peptide, ubiquitinated proteins and other autophagic substrates within autolysosomes/lysosomes and reduced intraneuronal amyloid-b peptide. The amelioration of lysosomal function in TgCRND8 markedly decreased extracellular amyloid deposition and total brain amyloid-b peptide 40 and 42 levels, and prevented the development of deficits of learning and memory in fear conditioning and olfactory habituation tests. Our findings support the pathogenic significance of autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and indicate the potential value of restoring normal autophagy as an innovative therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.

abstract = {Macroautophagy, which is a lysosomal pathway for the turnover of organelles and long-lived proteins, is a key determinant of cell survival and longevity. In this study, we show that neuronal macroautophagy is induced early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and before beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits extracellularly in the presenilin (PS) 1/Abeta precursor protein (APP) mouse model of beta-amyloidosis. Subsequently, autophagosomes and late autophagic vacuoles (AVs) accumulate markedly in dystrophic dendrites, implying an impaired maturation of AVs to lysosomes. Immunolabeling identifies AVs in the brain as a major reservoir of intracellular Abeta. Purified AVs contain APP and beta-cleaved APP and are highly enriched in PS1, nicastrin, and PS-dependent gamma-secretase activity. Inducing or inhibiting macroautophagy in neuronal and nonneuronal cells by modulating mammalian target of rapamycin kinase elicits parallel changes in AV proliferation and Abeta production. Our results, therefore, link beta-amyloidogenic and cell survival pathways through macroautophagy, which is activated and is abnormal in AD.},

Our study evaluated the effect of subchronic PQ exposure on the neuropathology, genotoxicity, and antioxidant activity on the nervous tissue of Drosophila melanogaster. We also explored the behavioral effect of PQ on D. melanogaster. Furthermore, we attempted to validate the mechanism by evaluating PQ-induced cytotoxicity on the D-Mel2 cell lines. The fruit fly D. melanogaster serves as a feasible model to understand the mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases. Our study shows a dose-dependent PQ-induced neuropathology in the brain tissue of D. melanogaster as evidenced by hematoxylin and eosin staining, silver nitrate staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Electron microscopic study of D. melanogaster brain tissue exhibited vacuolar degeneration and significant neuronal damage across the nervous tissue structure in comparison with control. Our findings also indicate a dose-dependent locomotor impairment and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) specific activity in PQ-treated D. melanogaster. These PQ-induced neuroanatomical changes and decreased SOD specific activity showed a significant association with oxidative DNA damage as observed by alkaline comet assay. Additionally, we show, for the first time, a dose-dependent PQ-induced cytotoxicity in the D-Mel2 cells suggesting loss of neuronal cell viability via cytotoxic damage. Our data suggest that PQ exposure results in neurodegeneration in D. melanogaster and that fruit fly is a suitable in vivo model for correlating the neuroanatomical changes with neurotoxic damages to nervous system.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved. Environmental exposure to paraquat has been reported to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). In experimental animal models paraquat reproduces features of PD, however, the exact mechanism of PD-induced neurotoxicity has not been fully established. This study was designed to investigate paraquat-mediated interference with mitochondrial function and autophagy, and determine the impact of the modulation of autophagy flux on paraquat-induced cell toxicity. Rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were treated with paraquat for 24 h to establish a cellular mode of PD induced neurotoxicity. Pre-incubation of PC12 cells with an antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or autophagy modulators rapamycin and chloroquine was conducted to determine the effect of modulation of oxidative status and autophagy flux on paraquat-elicited cytotoxicity. Mitochondrial functions and dynamics were analyzed by measuring oxygen consumption in a high-resolution oxygraph and imaging with a fluorescent mitochondrial dye (MitoTracker). Reactive oxygen species was determined by flow cytometry using fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. Autophagic flux was determined by Western blot analysis of autophagy marker LC3-II as well as p62 expression. It was found that treatment of cells with paraquat caused a concentration-dependent loss of cell viability that was accompanied by a decrease in cell respiration and reduction of polarized mitochondria, which was prevented by pretreatment of cells with NAC. Analysis of autophagy showed that NAC inhibited basic autophagy flux of PC12 cells, as evidenced by a decrease in LC3-II level and an increase in p62 expression. However, this modulation of autophagy by NAC may not be implicated into its cellular protective mechanism over paraquat cytotoxicity as inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine significantly enhanced paraquat induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the autophagy inducer rapamycin dramatically decreased paraquat induced cellular toxicity in PC12 cells. The present study demonstrates that basal autophagy plays a protective role in paraquat-induced cell toxicity. Antioxidant NAC confers protective role in paraquat toxicity mainly through maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and function, other than a modulation of autophagy flux.},

The Ca2+ released through ryanodine (RyR) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3R) receptors was shown to be involved in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, Bax translocation to mitochondria and apoptotic death. Our data further demonstrate that Ca2+ released from the ER leads to the depletion of endogenous GSH levels and accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which were also involved in the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. These results illustrate that the early A$\beta$- and PrP -induced perturbation of ER Ca2+ homeostasis affects mitochondrial function, activating the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway and help to clarify the mechanism implicated in neuronal death that occurs in AD and PrD. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Abundant evidence not only demonstrates the full spectrum of oxidative damage to neuronal macromolecules, but also reveals the occurrence of oxidative events early in the course of the disease and prior to the formation of the pathology, which support an important role of oxidative stress in AD. As a disease of abnormal aging, AD demonstrates oxidative damage at levels that significantly surpass that of elderly controls, which suggests the involvement of additional factor(s). Structurally and functionally damaged mitochondria, which are more proficient at producing reactive oxygen species but less so in ATP, are also an early and prominent feature of the disease. Since mitochondria are also vulnerable to oxidative stress, it is likely that a vicious downward spiral involving the interactions between mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contributes to the initiation and/or amplification of reactive oxygen species that is critical to the pathogenesis of AD.

abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases are age-related and relentlessly progressive with increasing prevalence and no cure or lasting symptomatic therapy. The well-recognized prodromal phase in many forms of neurodegeneration suggests a prolonged period of neuronal compensated dysfunction prior to cell loss that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Although most efforts to date have been focused on misfolded toxic proteins, it is now clear that widespread changes in protein homeostasis occur early in these diseases and understanding this fundamental biology is key to the design of targeted therapies. What has emerged from molecular genetics and animal studies is a previously less appreciated association of neurodegenerative diseases with defects in the molecular regulation of protein trafficking between cellular organelles, especially the intricate network of endosomes, lysosomes, autophagosomes and mitochondria. Here we summarized the broader concepts that stemmed from this Special Issue on "Protein Clearance in Neurodegenerative diseases: from mechanisms to therapies".

abstract = {The aging process drives the progressive deterioration of an organism and is thus subject to a complex interplay of regulatory and executing mechanisms. Our understanding of this process eventually aims at the delay and/or prevention of age-related pathologies, among them the age-dependent decrease in cognitive performance (e.g., learning and memory). Using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which combines a generally high mechanistic conservation with an efficient experimental access regarding aging and memory studies, we have recently unveiled a protective function of polyamines (including spermidine) against age-induced memory impairment (AMI). The flies' age-dependent decline of aversive olfactory memory, an established model for AMI, can be rescued by both pharmacological treatment with spermidine and genetic modulation that increases endogenous polyamine levels. Notably, we find that this effect strictly depends on autophagy, which is remarkable in light of the fact that autophagy is considered a key regulator of aging in other contexts. Given that polyamines in general and spermidine in particular are endogenous metabolites, our findings place them as candidate target substances for AMI treatment.},

abstract = {Pivotal brain functions, such as neurotransmission, cognition, and memory, decline with advancing age and, especially, in neurodegenerative conditions associated with aging, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, deterioration in structure and function of the nervous system during aging or in AD is not uniform throughout the brain. Selective neuronal vulnerability (SNV) is a general but sometimes overlooked characteristic of brain aging and AD. There is little known at the molecular level to account for the phenomenon of SNV. Functional genomic analyses, through unbiased whole genome expression studies, could lead to new insights into a complex process such as SNV. Genomic data generated using both human brain tissue and brains from animal models of aging and AD were analyzed in this review. Convergent trends that have emerged from these data sets were considered in identifying possible molecular and cellular pathways involved in SNV. It appears that during normal brain aging and in AD, neurons vulnerable to injury or cell death are characterized by significant decreases in the expression of genes related to mitochondrial metabolism and energy production. In AD, vulnerable neurons also exhibit down-regulation of genes related to synaptic neurotransmission and vesicular transport, cytoskeletal structure and function, and neurotrophic factor activity. A prominent category of genes that are up-regulated in AD are those related to inflammatory response and some components of calcium signaling. These genomic differences between sensitive and resistant neurons can now be used to explore the molecular underpinnings of previously suggested mechanisms of cell injury in aging and AD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of carbamazepine in the treatment of agitation and aggression associated with dementia were assessed. METHOD: In a 6-week, randomized, multisite, parallel-group study of 51 nursing home patients with agitation and dementia, individualized doses of carbamazepine were compared with placebo. Except for a physician monitor and a pharmacist, all participants were blind to treatment. The primary outcome measures were the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) global improvement rating. Secondary measures included measures of behavior, aggression, cognition, functional status, staff time, safety, and tolerability. Intent-to-treat analysis was performed. RESULTS: The modal carbamazepine dose at 6 weeks was 300 mg/day, and a mean serum level of 5.3 micrograms/ml was achieved. The study was terminated after a planned interim analysis showed that carbamazepine provided more benefit than did placebo. Over 6 weeks the mean total BPRS score decreased 7.7 points for the carbamazepine group and 0.9 for the placebo group, and the weekly scores showed a gradual divergence between the two groups. CGI ratings showed global improvement in 77{\%} of the patients taking carbamazepine and 21{\%} of those taking placebo. Secondary analyses confirmed that the positive changes were due to decreased agitation and aggression. The drug was generally well tolerated, and no change in cognition or functional status occurred. The perception of staff time needed to manage agitation showed a decrease for carbamazepine but not placebo. CONCLUSIONS: This controlled study showed significant short-term efficacy of carbamazepine for agitation with generally good safety and tolerability.},

abstract = {Background: The evidence base on the prevalence of dementia is expanding rapidly, particularly in countries with low and middle incomes. A reappraisal of global prevalence and numbers is due, given the significant implications for social and public policy and planning. Methods: In this study we provide a systematic review of the global literature on the prevalence of dementia (1980-2009) and metaanalysis to estimate the prevalence and numbers of those affected, aged ≥60 years in 21 Global Burden of Disease regions. Results: Age-standardized prevalence for those aged ≥60 years varied in a narrow band, 5{\%}-7{\%} in most world regions, with a higher prevalence in Latin America (8.5{\%}), and a distinctively lower prevalence in the four sub-Saharan African regions (2{\%}-4{\%}). It was estimated that 35.6 million people lived with dementia worldwide in 2010, with numbers expected to almost double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. In 2010, 58{\%} of all people with dementia lived in countries with low or middle incomes, with this proportion anticipated to rise to 63{\%} in 2030 and 71{\%} in 2050. Conclusion: The detailed estimates in this study constitute the best current basis for policymaking, planning, and allocation of health and welfare resources in dementia care. The age-specific prevalence of dementia varies little between world regions, and may converge further. Future projections of numbers of people with dementia may be modified substantially by preventive interventions (lowering incidence), improvements in treatment and care (prolonging survival), and disease-modifying interventions (preventing or slowing progression). All countries need to commission nationally representative surveys that are repeated regularly to monitor trends. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Dynamic variations in mitochondrial shape have been related to function. However, tools to automatically classify and enumerate mitochondrial shapes are lacking, as are systematic studies exploring the relationship of such shapes to mitochondrial stress. Here we show that during increased generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), mitochondria change their shape from tubular to donut or blob forms, which can be computationally quantified. Imaging of cells treated with rotenone or antimycin, showed time and dose-dependent conversion of tubular forms to donut-shaped mitochondria followed by appearance of blob forms. Time-lapse images showed reversible transitions from tubular to donut shapes and unidirectional transitions between donut and blob shapes. Blobs were the predominant sources of mtROS and appeared to be related to mitochondrial-calcium influx. Mitochondrial shape change could be prevented by either pretreatment with antioxidants like N-acetyl cysteine or inhibition of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter. This work represents a novel approach towards relating mitochondrial shape to function, through integration of cellular markers and a novel shape classification algorithm.},

abstract = {From a morphological perspective, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is primarily a degenerative disorder of the neuronal cytoskeleton involving lipofuscin-laden cortical projection neurons with long, thin, and sparsely myelinated axons. The neocortical primary fields, relatively small in extent but functionally sophisticated, exhibit an early and brief myelination cycle, whereas the much more expansive but relatively simply organized association areas undergo a late and prolonged myelination process. The greater the degree of myelination and the less intense the pigmentation, the more resistant a given projection neuron may be to oxidative stress as well as to the development of AD-related neurofibrillary changes and vice versa. The neurofibrillary pathology commences from those cortical areas that are less completely myelinated and gradually progresses to the most functionally developed cortical fields that display the highest degree of myelination, thereby reflecting a hierarchy in the susceptibility of diverse cortical areas to the evolution of the AD-associated cytoskeletal pathology.},

abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy has become an essential tool for biological research because it can be minimally invasive, acquire data rapidly, and target molecules of interest with specific labeling strategies. However, the diffraction-limited spatial resolution, which is classically limited to about 200nm in the lateral direction and about 500nm in the axial direction, hampers its application to identify delicate details of subcellular structure. Extensive efforts have been made to break diffraction limit for obtaining high-resolution imaging of a biological specimen. Various methods capable of obtaining super-resolution images with a resolution of tens of nanometers are currently available. These super-resolution techniques can be generally divided into three primary classes: (1) patterned illumination-based super-resolution imaging, which employs spatially and temporally modulated illumination light to reconstruct sub-diffraction structures; (2) single-molecule localization-based super-resolution imaging, which localizes the profile center of each individual fluorophore at subdiffraction precision; (3) bleaching/blinking-based super-resolution imaging. These super-resolution techniques have been utilized in different biological fields and provide novel insights into several new aspects of life science. Given unique technical merits and commercial availability of super-resolution fluorescence microscope, increasing applications of this powerful technique in life science can be expected. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

@article{Lin2015,
abstract = {Mitochondria are cellular power plants that supply ATP to power various biological activities essential for neuronal growth, survival, and function. Due to unique morphological features, neurons face exceptional challenges to maintain ATP and Ca2+ homeostasis. Neurons require specialized mechanisms distributing mitochondria to distal areas where energy and Ca2+ buffering are in high demand, such as synapses and axonal branches. These distal compartments also undergo development- and activity-dependent remodeling, thereby altering mitochondrial trafficking and distribution. Mitochondria move bi-directionally, pause briefly, and move again, frequently changing direction. In mature neurons, only one-third of axonal mitochondria are motile. Stationary mitochondria serve as local energy sources and buffer intracellular Ca2+. The balance between motile and stationary mitochondria responds quickly to changes in axonal and synaptic physiology. Furthermore, neurons are postmitotic cells surviving for the lifetime of the organism; thus, mitochondria need to be removed when they become aged or dysfunction. Mitochondria also alter their motility under stress conditions or when their integrity is impaired. Therefore, regulation of mitochondrial transport is essential to meet altered metabolic requirements and to remove aged and damaged mitochondria or replenish healthy ones to distal terminals. Defects in mitochondrial transport and altered distribution are implicated in the pathogenesis of several major neurological disorders. Thus, research into the mechanisms regulating mitochondrial motility is an important emerging frontier in neurobiology. This short review provides an updated overview on motor-adaptor machineries that drive and regulate mitochondrial transport and docking receptors that anchor axonal mitochondria in response to the changes in synaptic activity, metabolic requirement, and altered mitochondrial integrity. The review focuses on microtubule (MT)-based mitochondrial trafficking and anchoring. Additional insight from different perspectives can be found in other in-depth reviews.},

Stimulation of autophagy is not always beneficial. During the implementation of therapies that modulate autophagy, the nature of the autophagic defect, the timing of intervention, and the optimal level and duration of modulation should be fully considered.},

abstract = {Several natural compounds found in health-related food items can inhibit acetyltransferases as they induce autophagy. Here we show that this applies to anacardic acid, curcumin, garcinol and spermidine, all of which reduce the acetylation level of cultured human cells as they induce signs of increased autophagic flux (such as the formation of green fluorescent protein-microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) puncta and the depletion of sequestosome-1, p62/SQSTM1) coupled to the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We performed a screen to identify the acetyltransferases whose depletion would activate autophagy and simultaneously inhibit mTORC1. The knockdown of only two acetyltransferases (among 43 candidates) had such effects: EP300 (E1A-binding protein p300), which is a lysine acetyltranferase, and NAA20 (N($\alpha$)-acetyltransferase 20, also known as NAT5), which catalyzes the N-terminal acetylation of methionine residues. Subsequent studies validated the capacity of a pharmacological EP300 inhibitor, C646, to induce autophagy in both normal and enucleated cells (cytoplasts), underscoring the capacity of EP300 to repress autophagy by cytoplasmic (non-nuclear) effects. Notably, anacardic acid, curcumin, garcinol and spermidine all inhibited the acetyltransferase activity of recombinant EP300 protein in vitro.

abstract = {Autophagy is a major intracellular catabolic pathway induced in response to amino acid starvation. Recent findings implicate it in diverse physiological/pathophysiological events, such as protein and organelle turnover, development, aging, pathogen infection, cell death, and neurodegeneration. However, experimental methods to monitor this process in mammalian cells are limited because of the deficiency of autophagic markers. Recently, MAP1‐LC3 (LC3), a mammalian homolog of the yeast ubiquitin‐like (UBL) protein Atg8, has been shown to selectively incorporate into the autophagosomal membrane, thus serving as a unique bona fide marker of autophagosomes in mammals. Thus, the autophagic activity can be largely determined by GFP‐LC3/LC3, predominantly associated with autophagosomes (when LC3 is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine), both biochemically and microscopically. However, current methods to quantify autophagic activity using LC3 are time consuming, labor intensive, and require expertise in accurate interpretation. In this chapter we describe the use of flow cytometry and fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) as a new assay designed to quantify autophagy in cells stably expressing GFP‐LC3. Flow cytometry is a well‐established technique for performing quantitative fluorescence measurements, allowing quick, accurate, and simultaneous determination of many parameters in cell subpopulations. Here flow cytometry and FACS were used to quantify the turnover of GFP‐LC3 (reflecting an autophagic flux) as a reliable and simple assay to measure autophagic activity in living mammalian cells.},

The aggregates usually consist of fibers containing misfolded protein with a beta-sheet conformation, termed amyloid. There is partial but not perfect overlap among the cells in which abnormal proteins are deposited and the cells that degenerate. The most likely explanation is that inclusions and other visible protein aggregates represent an end stage of a molecular cascade of several steps, and that earlier steps in the cascade may be more directly tied to pathogenesis than the inclusions themselves. For several diseases, genetic variants assist in explaining the pathogenesis of the more common sporadic forms and developing mouse and other models. There is now increased understanding of the pathways involved in protein aggregation, and some recent clues have emerged as to the molecular mechanisms of cellular toxicity. These are leading to approaches toward rational therapeutics.},

abstract = {Paraquat (PQ) is a potential human neurotoxicant and is used in models of oxidative stress. We determined the toxicokinetics (TK) and toxicodynamics (TD) of PQ in adult mouse brain following repeated or prolonged PQ exposure. PQ accumulated in different brain regions and reached a plateau after ∼ 18 i.p. (10 mg/kg) doses and resulted in modest morbidity and mortality unpredictably associated with dose interval and number. PQ had divergent effects on horizontal locomotor behavior depending on the number of doses. PQ decreased striatal dopamine levels after the 18th to 36th i.p. dose (10 mg/kg) and reduced the striatal level of tyrosine hydroxylase. Drinking water exposure to PQ (0.03- 0.05 mg/ml) did not result in any mortality and resulted in concentration and time dependent levels in the brain. The brain half-life of PQ varied with mouse strain. PQ accumulates and may saturate a site in mouse brain resulting in complex PQ level and duration-related consequences. These findings should alter our risk assessment of this compound and demonstrate a useful, but complex dynamic model for understanding the consequences of PQ in the brain. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {The role of autophagy as a survival strategy of cells constitutes an emerging topic in the study of the pathogenesis of several diseases with autophagic changes being described in a number of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the etiology of PD is still unknown, both environmental (for example, paraquat exposure) and genetic factors have been investigated as putative causes of the disease. In the latter case, mutations or changes in the protein DJ-1 have been reported to be associated with autosomal recessive, early-onset parkinsonism. In this paper we established a model system to study the involvement of the DJ-1 protein in paraquat-induced autophagy. When human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with DJ-1-specific small interfering RNAs and exposed to paraquat, we observed (i) sensitization additive with paraquat-induced apoptotic cell death, (ii) inhibition of the cytoplasmic accumulation of autophagic vacuoles as well as the recruitment of LC3 fusion protein to the vacuoles, (iii) exacerbation of apoptotic cell death in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine, and (iv) an increase in mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings suggest an active role for DJ-1 in the autophagic response produced by paraquat, providing evidence for the role of PD-related proteins in the autophagic degradation pathway, a factor that should be considered in the design of potential therapies for the treatment of the disease. ? 2009 International Society for Neurochemistry.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease with genetic (70{\%}) and environmental (30{\%}) causes. Among the genetic factors are genes associated with a family history of the disease (familial AD, FAD) and sporadic AD (SAD). The genes: APP (amyloid precursor protein), PSEN1 (Presenilin 1) and PSEN2 (Presenilin 2) are responsible for the presence of FAD. The APOE gene is responsible for the sporadic form of the disease. Other molecular factors related to the immunological cause (TREM2) of the disease are a disorder of the lipid (ABCA1, ABCA7) or biothiol (MTHFD1) metabolism and of the transport of metabolites (BIN1). Currently, it is believed that APOE is a risk factor for both SAD and late-onset FAD. The pathomechanism of AD is most commonly explained as based on the amyloid cascade theory. This theory is related to the FAD, although there are reports indicating the probability of its occurrence in the SAD. It seems that the excessive deposition of $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein hyperphosphorylated forms contribute to the damage of both DNA and RNA. Furthermore, it is believed that RNA-interference can affect both the level of pathological proteins (A$\beta$, tau protein) and the onset and progress of AD. It seems that a complete understanding of both FAD and SAD pathogenesis may contribute to the search for earlier clinical diagnosis and to an understanding of later occurrence of the disease, which may help modify its course and affect more effective therapy of this incurable neurological disease.},

abstract = {1. Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the world, and there is a clear need to develop new therapeutics for the stroke victim. To address this need, we generated a combinatorial library of polyamine compounds based on sFTX-3.3 toxin from which L-Arginyl-3,4-Spermidine (L-Arg-3,4) emerged as a lead neuroprotective compound. In the present study, we have extended earlier results to examine the compound's neuroprotective actions in greater detail. 2. In an in vitro ischaemia model, L-Arg-3,4 significantly reduced CA1 cell death when administered prior to induction of 60 min of ischaemia as well as when administered immediately after ischaemia. Surprisingly, L-Arg-3,4 continued to prevent cell death significantly when administration was delayed for as long as 60 min after ischaemia. 3. L-Arg-3,4 significantly reduced cell death in excitotoxicity models mediated by glutamate, NMDA, AMPA, or kainate. Unlike glutamate receptor antagonists, 300 microM L-Arg-3,4 did not suppress synaptic transmission as measured by evoked responses in acute hippocampal slices. 4. L-Arg-3,4 provided significant protection, in vitro, in a superoxide mediated injury model and prevented an increase of superoxide production after AMPA or NMDA stimulation. It also decreased nitric oxide production after in vitro ischaemia and NMDA stimulation, but did so without inhibiting nitric oxide synthase directly. 5. Furthermore, L-Arg-3,4 was significantly neuroprotective in an in vivo model of global forebrain ischaemia, without any apparent neurological side-effects. 6. Taken together, these results demonstrate that L-Arg-3,4 is protective in several models of neurodegeneration and may have potential as a new therapeutic compound for the treatment of stroke, trauma, and other neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress (OS), caused by the imbalance between the generation and detoxification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), plays an important role in brain aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and other related adverse conditions, such as ischemia. While ROS/RNS serve as signaling molecules at physiological levels, an excessive amount of these molecules leads to oxidative modification and, therefore, dysfunction of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. The response of neurons to this pervasive stress, however, is not uniform in the brain. While many brain neurons can cope with a rise in OS, there are select populations of neurons in the brain that are vulnerable. Because of their selective vulnerability, these neurons are usually the first to exhibit functional decline and cell death during normal aging, or in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of selective neuronal vulnerability (SNV) to OS is important in the development of future intervention approaches to protect such vulnerable neurons from the stresses of the aging process and the pathological states that lead to neurodegeneration. In this review, the currently known molecular and cellular factors that contribute to SNV to OS are summarized. Included among the major underlying factors are high intrinsic OS, high demand for ROS/RNS-based signaling, low ATP production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and high inflammatory response in vulnerable neurons. The contribution to the selective vulnerability of neurons to OS by other intrinsic or extrinsic factors, such as deficient DNA damage repair, low calcium-buffering capacity, and glutamate excitotoxicity, are also discussed.},

abstract = {Polyamines (PAs) are indispensable polycations ubiquitous to all living cells. Among their many critical functions, PAs contribute to the oxidative balance of the cell. Beginning with studies by the Tabor laboratory in bacteria and yeast, the requirement for PAs as protectors against oxygen radical-mediated damage has been well established in many organisms, including mammals. However, PAs also serve as substrates for oxidation reactions that produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) both intra- and extracellularly. As intracellular concentrations of PAs can reach millimolar concentrations, the H2O2 amounts produced through their catabolism, coupled with a reduction in protective PAs, are sufficient to cause the oxidative damage associated with many pathologies, including cancer. Thus, the maintenance of intracellular polyamine homeostasis may ultimately contribute to the maintenance of oxidative homeostasis. Again, pioneering studies by Tabor and colleagues led the way in first identifying spermine oxidase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They also first purified the extracellular bovine serum amine oxidase and elucidated the products of its oxidation of primary amine groups of PAs when included in culture medium. These investigations formed the foundation for many polyamine-related studies and experimental procedures still performed today. This Minireview will summarize key innovative studies regarding PAs and oxidative damage, starting with those from the Tabor laboratory and including the most recent advances, with a focus on mammalian systems.},

abstract = {Competition between glucose and lactate as oxidative energy substrates was investigated in both primary cultures of astrocytes and neurons using physiological concentrations (1.1 mm for each). Glucose metabolism was distinguished from lactate metabolism by using alternatively labelled substrates in the medium ([1- 13 C]glucose + lactate or glucose + [3- 13 C]lactate). After 4 h of incubation, 1 H and 13 C-NMR spectra were realized on perchloric acid extracts of both cells and culture media. For astrocytic cultures, spectra showed that amino acids (glutamine and alanine) were more labelled in the glucose-labelled condition, indicating that glucose is a better substrate to support oxidative metabolism in these cells. The opposite was observed on spectra from neuronal cultures, glutamate being much more labelled in the lactate-labelled condition, confirming that neurons consume lactate preferentially as an oxidative energy substrate. Analysis of glutamine and glutamate peaks (singlets or multiplets) also suggests that astrocytes have a less active oxidative metabolism than neurons. In contrast, they exhibit a stronger glycolytic metabolism than neurons as indicated by their high lactate production yield. Using a mathematical model, we have estimated the relative contribution of exogenous glucose and lactate to neuronal oxidative metabolism. Under the aforementioned conditions, it represents 25{\%} for glucose and 75{\%} for lactate. Altogether, these results obtained on separate astrocytic and neuronal cultures support the idea that lactate, predominantly produced by astrocytes, is used as a supplementary fuel by neurons in vivo already under resting physiological conditions. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2006).},

abstract = {As post-mitotic cells with great energy demands, neurons depend upon the homeostatic and waste-recycling functions provided by autophagy. In addition, autophagy also promotes survival during periods of harsh stress and targets aggregate-prone proteins associated with neurodegeneration for degradation. Despite this, autophagy has also been controversially described as a mechanism of programmed cell death. Instances of autophagic cell death are typically associated with elevated numbers of cytoplasmic autophagosomes, which have been assumed to lead to excessive degradation of cellular components. Due to the high activity and reliance on autophagy in neurons, these cells may be particularly susceptible to autophagic death. In this review, we summarize and assess current evidence in support of autophagic cell death in neurons, as well as how the dysregulation of autophagy commonly seen in neurodegeneration can contribute to neuron loss. From here, we discuss potential treatment strategies relevant to such cell-death pathways.},

abstract = {Autophagy is an intracellular degradation process by which cytoplasmic contents are degraded in the lysosome. In addition to nonselective engulfment of cytoplasmic materials, the autophagosomal membrane can selectively recognize specific proteins and organelles. It is generally believed that the major selective substrate (or cargo receptor) p62 is recruited to the autophagosomal membrane through interaction with LC3. In this study, we analyzed loading of p62 and its related protein NBR1 and found that they localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated autophagosome formation site independently of LC3 localization to membranes. p62 colocalizes with upstream autophagy factors such as ULK1 and VMP1 even when autophagosome formation is blocked by wortmannin or FIP200 knockout. Self-oligomerization of p62 is essential for its localization to the autophagosome formation site. These results suggest that p62 localizes to the autophagosome formation site on the ER, where autophagosomes are nucleated. This process is similar to the yeast cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway.},

abstract = {Cathepsin D-deficient (CD-/-) mice have been shown to manifest seizures and become blind near the terminal stage [approximately postnatal day (P) 26]. We therefore examined the morphological, immunocytochemical, and biochemical features of CNS tissues of these mice. By electron microscopy, autophagosome/autolysosome-like bodies containing part of the cytoplasm, granular osmiophilic deposits, and fingerprint profiles were demonstrated in the neuronal perikarya of CD-/- mouse brains after P20. Autophagosomes and granular osmiophilic deposits were detected in neurons at P0 but were few in number, whereas they increased in the neuronal perikarya within days after birth. Some large-sized neurons having autophagosome/autolysosome-like bodies in the perikarya appeared in the CNS tissues, especially in the thalamic region and the cerebral cortex, at P17. These lysosomal bodies occupied the perikarya of almost all neurons in CD-/- mouse brains obtained from P23 until the terminal stage. Because these neurons exhibited autofluorescence, it was considered that ceroid lipofuscin may accumulate in lysosomal structures of CD-/- neurons. Subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase was found to accumulate in the lysosomes of neurons, although the activity of tripeptidyl peptidase-I significantly increased in the brain. Moreover, neurons near the terminal stage were often shrunken and possessed irregular nuclei through which small dense chromatin masses were scattered. These results suggest that the CNS neurons in CD-/- mice show a new form of lysosomal accumulation disease with a phenotype resembling neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. When macroautophagy (autophagy) is induced by nutrient starvation or rapamycin treatment, Atg (autophagy-related) proteins are assembled at a restricted region close to the vacuole. Subsequently, the phagophore expands to form a closed autophagosome. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells overexpressing precursor Ape1 (prApe1), a specific autophagosome cargo protein, the phagophore can be visualized as a cup-shaped structure labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Atg8. Previously, our group has shown that the maximum length of GFP-Atg8-labeled structures reflects the magnitude of bulk autophagy. In that study, the morphological parameters of the autophagy-related structures were extracted manually, requiring a great deal of time. Moreover, only well-expanded phagophores were subjected to further analysis. Here we report Qautas (Quantitative autophagy-related structure analysis system), a high-throughput and comprehensive system for morphological analysis of autophagy-related structures using a combination of image processing and machine learning. We describe both the manual method and Qautas in detail.},

Newly formed cytosegresomes containing unaltered organelles were spatially unrelated to preexisting labelled lysosomes and appeared to represent "pre-lysosomes" of the autophagosome type lacking lysosomal enzyme.

abstract = {The Apaf-1 apoptosome is a multi-subunit caspase-activating scaffold that is assembled in response to diverse forms of cellular stress that culminate in apoptosis. To date, most studies on apoptosome composition and function have used apoptosomes reassembled from recombinant or purified proteins. Thus, the precise composition of native apoptosomes remains unresolved. Here, we have used a one-step immunopurification approach to isolate catalytically active Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosomes, and have identified the major constituents of these complexes using mass spectrometry methods. Using this approach, we have also assessed the ability of putative apoptosome regulatory proteins, such as Smac/DIABLO and PHAPI, to regulate the activity of native apoptosomes. We show that Apaf-1, caspase-9, caspase-3 and XIAP are the major constituents of native apoptosomes and that cytochrome c is not stably associated with the active complex. We also demonstrate that the IAP-neutralizing protein Smac/DIABLO and the tumor-suppressor protein PHAPI can enhance the catalytic activity of apoptosome complexes in distinct ways. Surprisingly, PHAPI also enhanced the activity of purified caspase-3, suggesting that it may act as a co-factor for this protease.},

This, in turn, seems to be intimately linked to their role as the major intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are mainly, generated at Complex I and III of the respiratory chain. Excessive ROS production can lead to oxidation of macromolecules and has been implicated in mtDNA mutations, ageing, and cell death. Although mitochondrial dysfunction can cause ATP depletion and necrosis, these organelles are also involved in the regulation of apoptotic cell death by mechanisms, which have been conserved through evolution. Thus, many lethal agents target the mitochondria and cause release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic proteins, which can trigger caspase activation and apoptosis. Taken together, these findings have placed the mitochondria in the focus of current cell death research.},

We modified a diamond knife to simplify serial section array acquisition with minimal artifacts. After array acquisition, the arrays were transferred to a glass coverslip or silicon wafer support. Using light microscopy, the arrays were screened rapidly for initial recognition of global anatomical features (organs or body traits). Then, using SEM, an in-depth study of the cells and/or organs of interest was performed. Our manual and automatic data acquisition strategies make 3D data acquisition and correlation simpler and more precise than alternative methods. This method can be used to address questions in cell and developmental biology that require the efficient identification of a labeled cell or organelle.},

The Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) proposes unified criteria for the definition of cell death and of its different morphologies, while formulating several caveats against the misuse of words and concepts that slow down progress in the area of cell death research. Authors, reviewers and editors of scientific periodicals are invited to abandon expressions like ‘percentage apoptosis' and to replace them with more accurate descriptions of the biochemical and cellular parameters that are actually measured. Moreover, at the present stage, it should be accepted that caspase-independent mechanisms can cooperate with (or substitute for) caspases in the execution of lethal signaling pathways and that ‘autophagic cell death' is a type of cell death occurring together with (but not necessarily by) autophagic vacuolization.

Patients with AD suffer a gradual deterioration of memory and other cognitive functions, which eventually leads to a complete incapacity and death. A complicated array of molecular events has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. The major pathological characteristics of AD brains are the presence of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Growing evidence has demonstrated that oxidative stress is an important factor contributing to the initiation and progression of AD. However, the mechanisms that lead to the disruption of redox balance and the sources of free radicals remain elusive. The excessive reactive oxygen species may be generated from mechanisms such as mitochondria dysfunction and/or aberrant accumulation of transition metals, while the abnormal accumulation of Abeta and tau proteins appears to promote the redox imbalance. The resulted oxidative stress has been implicated in Abeta- or tau-induced neurotoxicity. In addition, evidence has suggested that oxidative stress may augment the production and aggregation of Abeta and facilitate the phosphorylation and polymerization of tau, thus forming a vicious cycle that promotes the initiation and progression of AD.},

We found that L-type Ca2+channel antagonists, the K+ATPchannel opener minoxidil, and the Gisignaling activator clonidine induce autophagy. These drugs revealed a cyclical mTOR-independent pathway regulating autophagy, in which cAMP regulates IP3levels, influencing calpain activity, which completes the cycle by cleaving and activating Gs$\alpha$, which regulates cAMP levels. This pathway has numerous potential points where autophagy can be induced, and we provide proof of principle for therapeutic relevance in Huntington's disease using mammalian cell, fly and zebrafish models. Our data also suggest that insults that elevate intracytosolic Ca2+(like excitotoxicity) inhibit autophagy, thus retarding clearance of aggregate-prone proteins. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

A mutant designated as apg1 (autophagy) defective in accumulation of autophagic bodies in the vacuoles was isolated by selection using a light microscope from a mutagenized proteinase-deficient strain. In the apg1 strain, which has normal vacuolar proteinases, nitrogen starvation did not induce protein degradation. The apg1 mutant lost its viability faster than wild-type cells during nitrogen starvation. By using the loss of viability as a first screening test, 75 other apg mutants were selected. These apg mutants including apg1 fell into 15 complementation groups. Genetic analyses of representative apg mutants revealed that they all had single recessive chromosomal mutations. Strains with each apg mutation were defective in protein degradation in the vacuoles induced by nitrogen starvation and homozygous diploids for each apg mutation did not sporulate. These results on the apg mutants suggest that autophagy via autophagic bodies is indispensable for protein degradation in the vacuoles under starvation conditions, and that at least 15 APG genes are involved in autophagy in yeast.},

abstract = {The BALB/c mouse model of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease exhibits neuropathological similarities to the human condition. There is an age-related cerebral atrophy, demyelination of the corpus callosum, and degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells in the NPC mouse. In human NPC, many cortical and subcortical neurons contain neurofibrillary tangles, which are thought by some investigators to play an important role in the neurodegenerative process. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether neurodegeneration occurs in the NPC mouse, in brain regions other than the cerebellum and whether the degeneration is related to the presence of neurofibrillary tangles. Using light microscopic methods with immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and cell counting methods, 11-week-old NPC(+/+) and NPC(-/-) animals were examined. In the NPC(-/-) mice, there were 96{\%} fewer Purkinje cells, 28{\%} fewer neurons in the prefrontal cortex, 20{\%} fewer neurons in the thalamus, and 63{\%} fewer glial cells in the corpus callosum. On the other hand, previous studies indicate normal numbers of neurons and glial cells in these same neuroanatomical regions in young NPC(-/-) mice. There were normal numbers of cholinergic neurons in sections assessed in the striatum and basal forebrain in the 11-week-old animals and no evidence of neurofibrillary tangles within cells. The present data indicate that both neurons and glial cells die in the NPC mouse but that all cells are not equally vulnerable. There was no evidence for neurofibrillary tangles in the NPC mouse, and therefore the degenerative process in the mouse is unrelated to the neurofibrillary tangle.},

abstract = {Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is the main intermediate filament protein in mature astrocytes, but also an important component of the cytoskeleton in astrocytes during development. Major recent developments in astrocyte biology and the discovery of novel intermediate filament functions enticed the interest in the function of GFAP. The discovery of various GFAP splice variants gave an additional boost to explore this protein in more detail. The structural role of GFAP in astrocytes has been widely accepted for a long time, but over the years, GFAP has been shown to be involved in astrocyte functions, which are important during regeneration, synaptic plasticity and reactive gliosis. Moreover, different subpopulations of astrocytes have been identified, which are likely to have distinctive tasks in brain physiology and pathology, and which are not only classified by their spatial and temporal appearance, but also by their specific expression of intermediate filaments, including distinct GFAP isoforms. The presence of these isoforms enhances the complexity of the astrocyte cytoskeleton and is likely to underlie subtype specific functions. In this review we discuss the versatility of the GFAP cytoskeletal network from gene to function with a focus on astrocytes during human brain development, aging and disease. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Neuronal cultures in vitro readily oxidized both D-[(14)C]glucose and l-[(14)C]lactate to (14)CO(2), whereas astroglial cultures oxidized both substrates sparingly and metabolized glucose predominantly to lactate and released it into the medium. [(14)C]Glucose oxidation to (14)CO(2) varied inversely with unlabeled lactate concentration in the medium, particularly in neurons, and increased progressively with decreasing lactate concentration. Adding unlabeled glucose to the medium inhibited [(14)C]lactate oxidation to (14)CO(2) only in astroglia but not in neurons, indicating a kinetic preference in neurons for oxidation of extracellular lactate over intracellular pyruvatelactate produced by glycolysis. Protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which regulates pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Dichloroacetate inhibits this kinase, thus enhancing PDH activity. In vitro dichloroacetate stimulated glucose and lactate oxidation to CO(2) and reduced lactate release mainly in astroglia, indicating that limitations in glucose and lactate oxidation by astroglia may be due to a greater balance of PDH toward the inactive form. To assess the significance of astroglial export of lactate to neurons in vivo, we attempted to diminish this traffic in rats by administering dichloroacetate (50 mgkg) intravenously to stimulate astroglial lactate oxidation and then examined the effects on baseline and functionally activated local cerebral glucose utilization (lCMR(glc)). Dichloroacetate raised baseline lCMR(glc) throughout the brain and decreased the percent increases in lCMR(glc) evoked by functional activation. These studies provide evidence in support of the compartmentalization of glucose metabolism between astroglia and neurons but indicate that the compartmentalization may be neither complete nor entirely obligatory.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are ligand-regulatable transcription factors. Currently, little is known about the expression of TRs or other nuclear hormone receptors during the cell cycle. We thus developed a stable expression system to express green fluorescent protein-TRbeta in HeLa cells under tetracycline regulation, and studied TR expression during the cell cycle by laser scanning cytometry. Only approximately 9-15{\%} of the nonsynchronized cell population expressed TR because the majority of cells were in G(1) phase and did not express detectable amounts of TR. However, when cells were synchronized in early S phase with hydroxyurea and then released, TR expression levels increased in a cell cycle-dependent manner and peaked to 30-40{\%} cells expressing TR at late G(2)/M phase before declining to nonsynchronized levels. Moreover, we observed a direct correlation between transcriptional activity and TR expression during the cell cycle. Similar cell cycle-dependent findings also were observed for endogenous TR in rat pituitary GH(3) cells. Last, cycloheximide studies demonstrated that the increase in TR expression was primarily due to increased translation. These novel observations of cell cycle-dependent expression of TR suggest that differential hormone sensitivity can occur during the cell cycle and may contribute to cell cycle progression during normal development and oncogenesis.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) may result from the accumulation of amyloid-?? (A??) peptides in the brain. The cysteine protease cathepsin B (CatB) is associated with amyloid plaques in AD brains and has been suspected to increase A?? production. Here, we demonstrate that CatB actually reduces levels of A?? peptides, especially the aggregation-prone species A??1-42, through proteolytic cleavage. Genetic inactivation of CatB in mice with neuronal expression of familial AD-mutant human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) increased the relative abundance of A??1-42, worsening plaque deposition and other AD-related pathologies. Lentivirus-mediated expression of CatB in aged hAPP mice reduced preexisting amyloid deposits, even thioflavin S-positive plaques. Under cell-free conditions, CatB effectively cleaved A??1-42, generating C-terminally truncated A?? peptides that are less amyloidogenic. Thus, CatB likely fulfills antiamyloidogenic and neuroprotective functions. Insufficient CatB activity might promote AD; increasing CatB activity could counteract the neuropathology of this disease. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Mitochondria are critical regulators of cell death, a key feature of neurodegeneration. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA and oxidative stress both contribute to ageing, which is the greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. In all major examples of these diseases there is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early and acts causally in disease pathogenesis. Moreover, an impressive number of disease-specific proteins interact with mitochondria. Thus, therapies targeting basic mitochondrial processes, such as energy metabolism or free-radical generation, or specific interactions of disease-related proteins with mitochondria, hold great promise},

During nervous system development, about one-and-a-half times the adult number of neurons are created. These "extra" neurons are then destroyed or commit suicide. This process of programmed cell death occurs through a series of events termed apoptosis and is an appropriate and essential event during brain development. Later in life, inappropriate neuronal cell death may result from pathological causes such as traumatic injury, environmental toxins, cardiovascular disorders, infectious agents, or genetic diseases. In some cases, the death occurs through apoptosis. In other cases, cell death is random, irreversible, and uncontrollable; to distinguish it from the controlled, planned cell death of apoptosis, we call this necrotic cell death. Understanding the difference between apoptotic and necrotic cell death is essential for designing therapies which will prevent or limit inappropriate cell death in the nervous system.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by cognitive impairments that progress to dementia and death. The earliest symptoms of AD present as a relatively pure deficit in memory retrieval. Therefore, drug treatments that intervene in the early stages of AD by rescuing memory deficits could be promising therapies to slow, or even reverse progression of the disease. In this study, we tested the potential of systemic histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) treatment to rescue cognitive deficits in a mouse model of AD. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice showed pronounced contextual memory impairments beginning at 6 months of age. Chronic HDACi injections (2-3 weeks) did not alter contextual memory formation in normal mice, but had profound effects in transgenic animals. Injections of sodium valproate, sodium butyrate, or vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; Zolinza) completely restored contextual memory in these mutant mice. Further behavioral testing of the HDACi-treated transgenic mice showed that the newly consolidated memories were stably maintained over a 2-week period. Measurement of the HDAC isoform selectivity profile of sodium valproate, sodium butyrate, and vorinostat revealed the common inhibition of class I HDACs (HDAC1, 2, 3, 8) with little effect on the class IIa HDAC family members (HDAC4, 5, 7, 9) and inhibition of HDAC6 only by vorinostat. These preclinical results indicate that targeted inhibition of class I HDAC isoforms is a promising avenue for treating the cognitive deficits associated with early stage AD.},

abstract = {Endocytosis is critical to the function and fate of molecules important to Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology, including the beta protein precursor (betaPP), amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Early endosomes, a major site of Abeta peptide generation, are markedly enlarged within neurons in the Alzheimer brain, suggesting altered endocytic pathway (EP) activity. Here, we show that neuronal EP activation is a specific and very early response in AD. To evaluate endocytic activation, we used markers of internalization (rab5, rabaptin 5) and recycling (rab4), and found that enlargement of rab5-positive early endosomes in the AD brain was associated with elevated levels of rab4 immunoreactive protein and translocation of rabaptin 5 to endosomes, implying that both endocytic uptake and recycling are activated. These abnormalities were evident in pyramidal neurons of the neocortex at preclinical stages of disease when Alzheimer-like neuropathology, such as Abeta deposition, was restricted to the entorhinal region. In Down syndrome, early endosomes were significantly enlarged in some pyramidal neurons as early as 28 weeks of gestation, decades before classical AD neuropathology develops. Markers of EP activity were only minimally influenced by normal aging and other neurodegenerative diseases studied. Inheritance of the epsilon4 allele of APOE, however, accentuated early endosome enlargement at preclinical stages of AD. By contrast, endosomes were normal in size at advanced stages of familial AD caused by mutations of presenilin 1 or 2, indicating that altered endocytosis is not a consequence of Abeta deposition. These results identify EP activation as the earliest known intraneuronal change to occur in sporadic AD, the most common form of AD. Given the important role of the EP in Abeta peptide generation and ApoE function, early endosomal abnormalities provide a mechanistic link between EP alterations, genetic susceptibility factors, and Abeta generation and suggest differences that may be involved in Abeta generation and beta amyloidogenesis in subtypes of AD.},

It is characterized by the formation of autophagosomes, double membrane organelles that engulf cytosolic components and organelles and degrade their contents upon fusion with lysosomes. Upregulation of autophagy in response to specific stimuli can be determined by evaluating autophagic flux. This is achieved by comparing the number of autophagosomes in the absence and presence of lysosomal inhibitors. While the determination of autophagic flux in isolated cells is well-documented, few studies have described its determination in tissues or in vivo. Here, we describe the evaluation of autophagic flux both in vivo and ex vivo in several tissues, after treatment with lysosomal inhibitors and exposure to classical autophagy-inducing stimuli. This method uses LC3 lipidation, as determined by Western blot, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Our findings demonstrate that autophagic flux can be evaluated in vivo and ex vivo in several tissues.},

The best studied autophagic marker is the LC3B and it is believed that only the amount of the LC3B-II correlates with the amount of the autophagic membranes. Whether the LC3A processing, aside to LC3B, is a valuable endogenous 'autophagic flux' marker is far less clear. The specificity of rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the LC3A and the LC3B was tested against the commercial available human recombinant proteins LC3A and LC3B. In order to measure 'autophagic flux' in mouse liver, lung, kidney and heart we used: (1) a lysosomotropic reagent chloroquine, which inhibit the intra-lysosomal acidification or their fusion with autophagosome, (2) nutrient starvation as an autophagic stimulus and (3) ionizing radiation, which is known to destabilize lysosomes. According to the immunoblotting work the LC3A protein follows discrete patterns of LC3A-I and LC3A-II changes in liver, lung, kidney and heart tissues of mice, whereas the LC3B protein didn't follow the same pattern under stressor conditions. We conclude that the endogenous LC3A processing is a major marker of autophagy flux in mouse model. Fractionated samples (soluble vs. membrane fractions) should be used in immunoblotting to allow discrimination between the LC3-I soluble and the LC3-II membrane protein and kinetics. Further, when dealing with in vivo models it is necessary to check the specificity of the antibodies used against the LC3A and LC3B proteins as their expression and responsiveness is not overlapping.},

Data indicate an exponential rise in the number of cases of AD, emphasizing the need for developing an effective treatment. AD also imposes tremendous emotional and financial burden to the patient's family and community. The disease has been studied over a century, but acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are the only drugs currently approved for its management. These drugs provide symptomatic improvement alone but do less to modify the disease process. The extensive insight into the molecular and cellular pathomechanism in AD over the past few decades has provided us significant progress in the understanding of the disease. A number of novel strategies that seek to modify the disease process have been developed. The major developments in this direction are the amyloid and tau based therapeutics, which could hold the key to treatment of AD in the near future. Several putative drugs have been thoroughly investigated in preclinical studies, but many of them have failed to produce results in the clinical scenario; therefore it is only prudent that lessons be learnt from the past mistakes. The current rationales and targets evaluated for therapeutic benefit in AD are reviewed in this article.

abstract = {The mechanisms underlying the selective targeting of specific brain regions by different neurodegenerative diseases is one of the most intriguing mysteries in medicine. For example, it is known that Alzheimer's disease primarily affects parts of the brain that play a role in memory, whereas Parkinson's disease predominantly affects parts of the brain that are involved in body movement. However, the reasons that other brain regions remain unaffected in these diseases are unknown. A better understanding of the phenomenon of selective vulnerability is required for the development of targeted therapeutic approaches that specifically protect affected neurons, thereby altering the disease course and preventing its progression. Prion diseases are a fascinating group of neurodegenerative diseases because they exhibit a wide phenotypic spectrum caused by different sequence perturbations in a single protein. The possible ways that mutations affecting this protein can cause several distinct neurodegenerative diseases are explored in this Review to highlight the complexity underlying selective vulnerability. The premise of this article is that selective vulnerability is determined by the interaction of specific protein conformers and region-specific microenvironments harboring unique combinations of subcellular components such as metals, chaperones and protein translation machinery. Given the abundance of potential contributory factors in the neurodegenerative process, a better understanding of how these factors interact will provide invaluable insight into disease mechanisms to guide therapeutic discovery.},

abstract = {To investigate the role of dynamic changes in actin cytoskeleton in cellular response to oxidative stress, we have analyzed the state of actin polymerization and synthesis in human alveolar cells exposed to paraquat, an oxidant agent. Cellular content of monomeric actin was assayed by DNase I inhibition. It decreased significantly in treated cells and depended on paraquat concentration. Paraquat treatment of cells caused an increase of the filamentous pool of actin and a parallel decrease of the monomeric one. Such shift was shown to be irreversible. SDS-PAGE of cytoskeletal fractions was performed under reducing and non-reducing conditions. No cross-linking of actin monomers to form large aggregates appeared to be related to the observed paraquat-induced increase of the filamentous actin pool. Morphological analyses by indirect immunofluorescence and ultrastructural examination confirmed the presence of microfilaments in treated cells. Conventional bundles of filaments were not observed, but numerous single filaments appeared dispersed within the cytoplasm. Pulse-chase experiments showed a strong increase of de novo synthesis of actin in treated cells, whereas actin degradation rate remained unaffected. In conclusion, the different approaches lead to a concordant picture of cellular response to oxidant stress at the level of the actin filament system. Actin pools are modified: the overall number of filaments increases, whereas the monomeric species decreases. As a result of the shift of actin from the monomeric pool to the filamentous one, the de novo synthesis of actin is increased.},

Here we report the toxicity effect of polyamines (spermidine and spermine) on cultured cells, especially on drug-resistant cancer cell lines, which resulted from the oxidative degradation of polyamines by amine oxidases in serum supplement. Upon adding spermidine or spermine, high concentration of H2O2,an enzyme oxidation product of polyamines, was generated in culture media containing ruminant serum, such as fetal bovine serum (FBS), calf serum, bovine serum, goat serum or horse serum, but not in the media containing human serum.

abstract = {The polyamines spermidine and spermine have been hypothesized to possess different functions in the protection of DNA from reactive oxygen species. The growth and survival of mouse fibroblasts unable to synthesize spermine were compared to their normal counterparts in their native and polyamine-depleted states in response to oxidative stress. The results of these studies suggest that when present at normal or supraphysiological concentrations, either spermidine or spermine can protect cells from reactive oxygen species. However, when polyamine pools are pharmacologically manipulated to produce cells with low levels of predominately spermine or spermidine, spermine appears to be more effective. Importantly, when cells are depleted of both glutathione and endogenous polyamines, they exhibit increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide as compared to glutathione depletion alone, suggesting that polyamines not only play a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress but this role is distinct from that played by glutathione.},

Intriguingly, these two imaging techniques are often viewed as complementary, yet separate entities. Recent technological advancements in microscopy techniques, labeling tools, and fixation or preparation procedures have fueled the development of a series of hybrid approaches that allow correlating functional fluorescence microscopy data and ultrastructural information from electron micrographs from a singular biological event. As correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) approaches become increasingly accessible, long-standing neurobiological questions regarding structure-function relation are being revisited. In this review, we will survey what developments in electron and light microscopy have spurred the advent of correlative approaches, highlight the most relevant CLEM techniques that are currently available, and discuss its potential and limitations with respect to neuronal and synapse-specific applications.},

abstract = {Osmotic homeostasis is fundamental for most cells, which face recurrent alterations of environmental osmolality that challenge cell viability. Protein damage is a consequence of hypertonic stress, but whether autophagy contributes to the osmoprotective response is unknown. Here, we investigated the possible implications of autophagy and microtubule organization on the response to hypertonic stress. We show that hypertonicity rapidly induced long-lived protein degradation, LC3-II generation and Ptdlns3K-dependent formation of LC3- and ATG12-positive puncta. Lysosomotropic agents chloroquine and bafilomycin A 1, but not nutrient deprivation or rapamycin treatment, further increased LC3-II generation, as well as ATG12-positive puncta, indicating that hypertonic stress increases autophagic flux. Autophagy induction upon hypertonic stress enhanced cell survival since cell death was increased by ATG12 siRNA-mediated knockdown and reduced by rapamycin. We additionally showed that hypertonicity induces fast reorganization of microtubule networks, which is associated with strong reorganization of microtubules at centrosomes and fragmentation of Golgi ribbons. Microtubule remodeling was associated with pericentrosomal clustering of ATG12-positive autolysosomes that colocalized with SQSTM1/p62 and ubiquitin, indicating that autophagy induced by hypertonic stress is at least partly selective. Efficient autophagy by hypertonic stress required microtubule remodeling and was DYNC/dynein-dependent as autophagosome clustering was enhanced by paclitaxel-induced microtubule stabilization and was reduced by nocodazole-induced tubulin depolymerization as well as chemical (EHNA) or genetic [DCTN2/dynactin 2 (p50) overexpression] interference of DYNC activity. The data document a general and hitherto overlooked mechanism, where autophagy and microtubule remodeling play prominent roles in the osmoprotective response.},

abstract = {alpha-Synuclein-containing aggregates represent a feature of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). However, mechanisms that promote intraneuronal alpha-synuclein assembly remain poorly understood. Because pesticides, particularly the herbicide paraquat, have been suggested to play a role as PD risk factors, the hypothesis that interactions between alpha-synuclein and these environmental agents may contribute to aggregate formation was tested in this study. Paraquat markedly accelerated the in vitro rate of alpha-synuclein fibril formation in a dose-dependent fashion. When mice were exposed to the herbicide, brain levels of alpha-synuclein were significantly increased. This up-regulation followed a consistent pattern, with higher alpha-synuclein at 2 days after each of three weekly paraquat injections and with protein levels returning to control values by day 7 post-treatment. Paraquat exposure was also accompanied by aggregate formation. Thioflavine S-positive structures accumulated within neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, and dual labeling and confocal imaging confirmed that these aggregates contained alpha-synuclein. The results suggest that up-regulation of alpha-synuclein as a consequence of toxicant insult and direct interactions between the protein and environmental agents are potential mechanisms leading to alpha-synuclein pathology in neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress plays an important role in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Disruptions in the physiologic maintenance of the redox potential in neurons interfere with several biological processes, ultimately leading to cell death. Evidence has been developed for oxidative and nitrative damage to key cellular components in the PD substantia nigra. A number of sources and mechanisms for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are recognized including the metabolism of dopamine itself, mitochondrial dysfunction, iron, neuroinflammatory cells, calcium, and aging. PD causing gene products including DJ-1, PINK1, parkin, alpha-synuclein and LRRK2 also impact in complex ways mitochondrial function leading to exacerbation of ROS generation and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Additionally, cellular homeostatic processes including the ubiquitin-proteasome system and mitophagy are impacted by oxidative stress. It is apparent that the interplay between these various mechanisms contributes to neurodegeneration in PD as a feed forward scenario where primary insults lead to oxidative stress, which damages key cellular pathogenetic proteins that in turn cause more ROS production. Animal models of PD have yielded some insights into the molecular pathways of neuronal degeneration and highlighted previously unknown mechanisms by which oxidative stress contributes to PD. However, therapeutic attempts to target the general state of oxidative stress in clinical trials have failed to demonstrate an impact on disease progression. Recent knowledge gained about the specific mechanisms related to PD gene products that modulate ROS production and the response of neurons to stress may provide targeted new approaches towards neuroprotection.},

These marker proteins allow identification of autophagic structures by fluorescence microscopy.

abstract = {Paraquat (PQ) is a relatively safe and effective herbicide used all over the world. PQ is very toxic to all living organisms; and many cases of acute poisoning and death have been reported over the past decade. The main suggested potential mechanism for PQ toxicity is the production of superoxide radicals from the metabolism of the PQ by microsomal enzyme systems, and by inducing mitochondrial toxicity. Mitochondria are considered to be a major source of reactive oxygen species in cells and according to this hypothesis, PQ, through suitable oxidation and reduction processes, is able to participate in the redox system in mitochondria. The potential ability of PQ to accept electrons from complex (I, II, III, IV) leads to rapid reaction with molecular oxygen to yield superoxide anion which can lead to the formation of more toxic reactive oxygen species, e.g., hydroxyl radical, often taken as the main toxicant. Lipid peroxidation due to PQ has been implicated in a number of deleterious effects such as increased membrane rigidity, osmotic fragility, decreased mitochondrial components, reduced mitochondrial survival and lipid fluidity. The biological effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is controlled by a wide spectrum of enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense mechanisms such as superoxide dismutas (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione. According to this hypothesis, the chemical cascades lead to the reduction of PQ, which reacts quite rapidly with molecular oxygen to yield superoxide anion. The generation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation are the main factors that lead to mitochondrial damage. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Alterations in macroautophagy, the main process responsible for bulk autophagic degradation, have been proposed to contribute to pathogenesis in Huntington's disease (HD), a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. However, the precise mechanism behind macroautophagy malfunction in HD is poorly understood. In this work, using cellular and mouse models of HD and cells from humans with HD, we have identified a primary defect in the ability of autophagic vacuoles to recognize cytosolic cargo in HD cells. Autophagic vacuoles form at normal or even enhanced rates in HD cells and are adequately eliminated by lysosomes, but they fail to efficiently trap cytosolic cargo in their lumen. We propose that inefficient engulfment of cytosolic components by autophagosomes is responsible for their slower turnover, functional decay and accumulation inside HD cells.},

Accumulating evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species-mediated reactions, particularly of neuronal lipids, are extensive in those AD brain areas directly involved in the disease processes. Traditional views claim that oxidative-mediated tissue injury in the AD brain is the result of neurodegeneration. In recent years, numerous investigations have pointed to the functional importance of oxidative imbalance as a crucial event in mediating AD pathogenesis. The availability of specific and sensitive markers to monitor in vivo oxidative stress, in combination with studies performed in living patients with clinical diagnosis of AD are helping us to elucidate these issues. The evidence we have accumulated so far clearly indicates that oxidative imbalance and subsequent oxidative stress are early events during the evolution of the disease, and secondary to specific mechanism(s) present in AD but not in other neurodegenerative diseases. These new concepts implicate that this phenomenon may play a more important role in AD pathogenesis than previously anticipated, and that any therapeutic intervention targeting oxidative stress should be initiated at the earliest possible stage of the disease.},

It accounts for the degradation of most long-lived proteins: cytoplasmic constituents, including organelles, are sequestered into autophagosomes, which subsequently fuse with lysosomes, where degradation occurs. Although the possible involvement of autophagy in homeostasis, development, cell death, and pathogenesis has been repeatedly pointed out, systematic in vivo analysis has not been performed in mammals, mainly because of a limitation of monitoring methods. To understand where and when autophagy occurs in vivo, we have generated transgenic mice systemically expressing GFP fused to LC3, which is a mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8 (Aut7/Apg8) and serves as a marker protein for autophagosomes. Fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that autophagy is differently induced by nutrient starvation in most tissues. In some tissues, autophagy even occurs actively without starvation treatments. Our results suggest that the regulation of autophagy is organ dependent and the role of autophagy is not restricted to the starvation response. This transgenic mouse model is a useful tool to study mammalian autophagy.},

abstract = {There is an open controversy about the role of surgery and anesthesia in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical studies have shown a high prevalence of these procedures in subjects with AD but the interpretation of these studies is difficult because of the co-existence of multiple variables. Experimental studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that small molecular weight volatile anesthetics enhance amyloidogenesis in vitro and produce behavioral deficits and brain lesions similar to those found in patients with AD. We examined the effect of co-treatment with trehalose on isoflurane-induced amyloidogenesis in mice. WT and APP(swe) mice, of 11 months of age, were exposed to 1{\%} isoflurane, 3 times, for 1.5 hours each time and sacrificed 24 hours after their last exposure to isoflurane. The right hemi-brain was used for histological analysis and the contra-lateral hemi-brain used for biochemical studies. In this study, we have shown that repetitive exposure to isoflurane in pre-symptomatic mature APP(swe) mice increases apoptosis in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, enhances astrogliosis and the expression of GFAP and that these effects are prevented by co-treatment with trehalose, a disaccharide with known effects as enhancer of autophagy. We have also confirmed that in our model the co-treatment with trehalose increases the expression of autophagic markers as well as the expression of chaperones. Cotreatment with trehalose reduces the levels of $\beta$ amyloid peptide aggregates, tau plaques and levels of phospho-tau. Our study, therefore, provides new therapeutic avenues that could help to prevent the putative pro-amyloidogenic properties of small volatile anesthetics.},

abstract = {To determine whether plasma lactate can be a significant fuel for human brain energy metabolism, infusions of [3-13C]lactate and1H-13C polarization transfer spectroscopy were used to detect the entry and utilization of lactate. During the 2 h infusion study,13C incorporation in the amino acid pools of glutamate and glutamine were measured with a 5 min time resolution. With a plasma concentration ([Lac]P) being in the 0.8-2.8 mmol/L range, the tissue lactate concentration ([Lac]B) was assessed as well as the fractional contribution of lactate to brain energy metabolism (CMRlac). From the measured relationship between unidirectional lactate influx (Vin) and plasma and brain lactate concentrations, lactate transport constants were calculated using a reversible Michaelis-Menten model. The results show that (1) in the physiological range, plasma lactate unidirectional transport (Vin) and concentration in tissue increase close to linearly with the lactate concentration in plasma; (2) the maximum potential contribution of plasma lactate to brain metabolism is 10{\%} under basal plasma lactate conditions of ∼1.0 mmol/L and as much as 60{\%} at supraphysiological plasma lactate concentrations when the transporters are. saturated; (3) the half-saturation constant KTis 5.1±2.7mmol/L and VMAXis 0.40±0.13 $\mu$mol • g-1• min-1(68{\%}confidence interval); and (4) the majority of plasma lactate is metabolized in neurons similar to glucose.

Patient profile Socio-demographic characteristics The patients' mean age was 70 years (SD±10.26) (range 37 -89 years); 61{\%} were female, 49{\%} were married and 34{\%} were widowed. The ethnic distribution was 64.9{\%} coloured, 28.5{\%} white, 6.6{\%} black, and 2{\%} Indian, which differs from that of older persons in the community that the clinic serves (44{\%} coloured, 44{\%} white, 11{\%} black, and 0.9{\%} Indian) 18 and distributions of older patients in other hospital departments (13{\%} of elderly patients who access the Emergency Department are black). Stroke predisposes to the development of dementia, and is more common in blacks than in whites. 19 Therefore it would be expected that more black patients would be at risk of, and present with a memory disorder consequent to, the development of vascular dementia. The proportion of white patients in the clinic (26{\%}) is similarly lower than the 44{\%} proportion of older whites in the hospital's catchment area population. Older whites who are more affluent may have access to private health care, whereas the poor rely on public health care. Family members cared for 79{\%} of the patients, 6{\%} were institutionalised, 10{\%} lived alone, and 74{\%} of those who lived with family lived with a spouse and/or adult children. Scant or no formal support is available to carers of such patients in South Africa. Few residential or respite care facilities are available, and numerous individuals with dementia must be cared for at home by family members. Primary caregivers consequently carry a heavy social and financial burden; some cease formal employment because of caregiving responsibilities. A cognitively impaired older individual's inability to perform daily activities, and the presence of behavioural and psychological symptoms, contribute to caregiver stress. 20 However, the comparatively low number of institutionalised patients could be due to cultural preferences, economic factors and availability of care from family members. 21 Older individuals with a memory disorder who live alone are vulnerable and constitute a high-risk group as there are few community support services, and access to old-age homes is limited.},

abstract = {Autophagy delivers cytoplasmic components and organelles to lysosomes for degradation. This pathway serves to degrade nonfunctional or unnecessary organelles and aggregate-prone and oxidized proteins to produce substrates for energy production and biosynthesis. Macroautophagy delivers large aggregates and whole organelles to lysosomes by first enveloping them into autophagosomes that then fuse with lysosomes. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) degrades proteins containing the KFERQ-like motif in their amino acid sequence, by transporting them from the cytosol across the lysosomal membrane into the lysosomal lumen. Autophagy is especially important for the survival and homeostasis of postmitotic cells like neurons, because these cells are not able to dilute accumulating detrimental substances and damaged organelles by cell division. Our current knowledge on the autophagic pathways and molecular mechanisms and regulation of autophagy will be summarized in this review. We will describe the physiological functions of macroautophagy and CMA in neuronal cells. Finally, we will summarize the current evidence showing that dysfunction of macroautophagy and/or CMA contributes to neuronal diseases. We will give an overview of our current knowledge on the role of autophagy in aging neurons, and focus on the role of autophagy in four types of neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, prion diseases, lysosomal storage diseases, and Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {Autophagy, the major lysosomal pathway for the turnover of intracellular organelles is markedly impaired in neurons in Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer mouse models. We have previously reported that severe lysosomal and amyloid neuropathology and associated cognitive deficits in the TgCRND8 Alzheimer mouse model can be ameliorated by restoring lysosomal proteolytic capacity and autophagy flux via genetic deletion of the lysosomal protease inhibitor, cystatin B. Here we present evidence that macroautophagy is a significant pathway for lipid turnover, which is defective in TgCRND8 brain where lipids accumulate as membranous structures and lipid droplets within giant neuronal autolysosomes. Levels of multiple lipid species including several sphingolipids (ceramide, ganglioside GM3, GM2, GM1, GD3 and GD1a), cardiolipin, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters are elevated in autophagic vacuole fractions and lysosomes isolated from TgCRND8 brain. Lipids are localized in autophagosomes and autolysosomes by double immunofluorescence analyses in wild-type mice and colocalization is increased in TgCRND8 mice where abnormally abundant GM2 ganglioside-positive granules are detected in neuronal lysosomes. Cystatin B deletion in TgCRND8 significantly reduces the number of GM2-positive granules and lowers the levels of GM2 and GM3 in lysosomes, decreases lipofuscin-related autofluorescence, and eliminates giant lipid-containing autolysosomes while increasing numbers of normal-sized autolysosomes/lysosomes with reduced content of undigested components. These findings have identified macroautophagy as a previously unappreciated route for delivering membrane lipids to lysosomes for turnover, a function that has so far been considered to be mediated exclusively through the endocytic pathway, and revealed that autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction in TgCRND8 brain impedes lysosomal turnover of lipids as well as proteins. The amelioration of lipid accumulation in TgCRND8 by removing cystatin B inhibition on lysosomal proteases suggests that enhancing lysosomal proteolysis improves the overall environment of the lysosome and its clearance functions, which may be possibly relevant to a broader range of lysosomal disorders beyond Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive impairment and multiple pathological lesions. At the molecular level, AD is characterized by overt amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) production and tau hyper-phosphorylation. Hence, pharmacological agents that can attenuate A$\beta$ accumulation and tau hyper-phosphorylation have potential promise for treatment of AD. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is believed to be one of such pharmacological agents. It is neuroprotective in neurodegenerative diseases and its primary action is thought to be via enhancement of autophagy, a biological process that not only facilitates the clearance of mutant proteins but also significantly reduces the build-up of toxic protein aggregates such as A$\beta$. Since rapamycin enhancement of autophagy has been associated with abrogation of AD pathological processes such as clearance of A$\beta$ and neurofibrillary tangles (NTFs) as well as reduction of tau hyper-phosphorylation and improvement of cognition, rapamycin is emerging as a potential therapeutic compound for AD.},

abstract = {Disruption of autophagy--a key homeostatic process in which cytosolic components are degraded and recycled through lysosomes--can cause neurodegeneration in tissue culture and in vivo. Upregulation of this pathway may be neuroprotective, and much effort is being invested in developing drugs that cross the blood brain barrier and increase neuronal autophagy. One well-recognized way of inducing autophagy is by food restriction, which upregulates autophagy in many organs including the liver; but current dogma holds that the brain escapes this effect, perhaps because it is a metabolically privileged site. Here, we have re-evaluated this tenet using a novel approach that allows us to detect, enumerate and characterize autophagosomes in vivo. We first validate the approach by showing that it allows the identification and characterization of autophagosomes in the livers of food-restricted mice. We use the method to identify constitutive autophagosomes in cortical neurons and Purkinje cells, and we show that short-term fasting leads to a dramatic upregulation in neuronal autophagy. The increased neuronal autophagy is revealed by changes in autophagosome abundance and characteristics, and by diminished neuronal mTOR activity in vivo, demonstrated by a reduction in levels of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein in Purkinje cells. The increased abundance of autophagosomes in Purkinje cells was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. Our data lead us to speculate that sporadic fasting might represent a simple, safe and inexpensive means to promote this potentially therapeutic neuronal response.},

Patients with AD suffer a gradual deterioration of memory and other cognitive functions, which eventually leads to a complete incapacity and death. A complicated array of molecular events has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. The major pathological characteristics of AD brains are the presence of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Growing evidence has demonstrated that oxidative stress is an important factor contributing to the initiation and progression of AD. However, the mechanisms that lead to the disruption of redox balance and the sources of free radicals remain elusive. The excessive reactive oxygen species may be generated from mechanisms such as mitochondria dysfunction and/or aberrant accumulation of transition metals, while the abnormal accumulation of Abeta and tau proteins appears to promote the redox imbalance. The resulted oxidative stress has been implicated in Abeta- or tau-induced neurotoxicity. In addition, evidence has suggested that oxidative stress may augment the production and aggregation of Abeta and facilitate the phosphorylation and polymerization of tau, thus forming a vicious cycle that promotes the initiation and progression of AD.},

abstract = {Parkinson disease (PD) and Alzheimer disease (AD), the two most common neurodegenerative disorders in American adults, are of purely genetic origin in a minority of cases and appear in most instances to arise through interactions among genetic and environmental factors. In this article we hypothesize that environmental exposures in early life may be of particular etiologic importance and review evidence for the early environmental origins of neurodegeneration. For PD the first recognized environmental cause, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), was identified in epidemiologic studies of drug abusers. Chemicals experimentally linked to PD include the insecticide rotenone and the herbicides paraquat and maneb; interaction has been observed between paraquat and maneb. In epidemiologic studies, manganese has been linked to parkinsonism. In dementia, lead is associated with increased risk in chronically exposed workers. Exposures of children in early life to lead, polychlorinated biphenyls, and methylmercury have been followed by persistent decrements in intelligence that may presage dementia. To discover new environmental causes of AD and PD, and to characterize relevant gene-environment interactions, we recommend that a large, prospective genetic and epidemiologic study be undertaken that will follow thousands of children from conception (or before) to old age. Additional approaches to etiologic discovery include establishing incidence registries for AD and PD, conducting targeted investigations in high-risk populations, and improving testing of the potential neurologic toxicity of chemicals.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that oxidative stress and mitochondrial respiratory failure with attendant decrease in energy output are implicated in nigral neuronal death in Parkinson disease (PD). It is not known, however, which cellular elements (neurons or glial cells) are major targets of oxygen- mediated damage. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) was shown earlier to react with proteins to form stable adducts that can be used as markers of oxidative stress-induced cellular damage. We report here results of immunochemical studies using polyclonal antibodies directed against HNE-protein conjugates to label the site of oxidative damage in control subjects (ages 18-99 years) and seven patients that died of PD (ages 57-78 years). All the nigral melanized neurons in one of the midbrain sections were counted and classified into three groups according to the intensity of immunostaining for HNE- modified proteins-i.e., no staining, weak staining, and intensely positive staining. On average, 58{\%} of nigral neurons were positively stained for HNE- modified proteins in PD; in contrast only 9{\%} of nigral neurons were positive in the control subjects; the difference was statistically significant (Mann- Whitney U test; P {\textless} 0.01). In contrast to the substantia nigra, the oculomotor neurons in the same midbrain sections showed no or only weak staining for HNE-modified proteins in both PD and control subjects; young control subjects did not show any immunostaining; however, aged control subjects showed weak staining in the oculomotor nucleus, suggesting age- related accumulation of HNE-modified proteins in the neuron. Our results indicate the presence of oxidative stress within nigral neurons in PD, and this oxidative stress may contribute to nigral cell death.},

abstract = {Huntington's disease is caused by an abnormal polyglutamine expansion within the protein huntingtin and is characterized by microscopic inclusion bodies of aggregated huntingtin and by the death of selected types of neuron. Whether inclusion bodies are pathogenic, incidental or a beneficial coping response is controversial. To resolve this issue we have developed an automated microscope that returns to precisely the same neuron after arbitrary intervals, even after cells have been removed from the microscope stage. Here we show, by survival analysis, that neurons die in a time-independent fashion but one that is dependent on mutant huntingtin dose and polyglutamine expansion; many neurons die without forming an inclusion body. Rather, the amount of diffuse intracellular huntingtin predicts whether and when inclusion body formation or death will occur. Surprisingly, inclusion body formation predicts improved survival and leads to decreased levels of mutant huntingtin elsewhere in a neuron. Thus, inclusion body formation can function as a coping response to toxic mutant huntingtin.},

Although the primary targets for the two proteins are different, they both share a common mechanism that involves formation of pore-like structure on the plasma membrane, consequent dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage. The combined effect of all this factors ultimately leads to neuronal cell death. Whereas beta amyloid acts on the astrocytic plasma membrane, exhibiting a tight dependence to the membrane cholesterol content, alpha–synuclein does not distinguish between type of membrane or cell. Additionally, oligomeric forms of both proteins produce reactive oxygen species through different mechanisms: beta-amyloid through activation of the NADPH oxidase and alpha-synuclein through non-enzymatic way. Finally, both peptides in oligomeric form induce mitochondrial depolarisation through calcium overload and free radical production that ultimately lead to opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and trigger cell death.},

abstract = {Mitophagy is an important mechanism in mitochondrial quality control through autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria and has been considered to assume protective roles against some diseases, especially neurodegeneration, including Parkinson's disease (Haelterman et al., 2014), and Alzheimer's disease (Ye et al., 2015). To understand the role of mitophagy in these diseases, measures to assess mitophagy are of great importance. Among those established methods, engulfment of mitochondria by autophagosome shown by transmission electron microscope (TEM) provides unequivocal evidence of occurrence of mitophagy (Klionsky et al., 2012). However, it demands painstaking effort and is difficult to quantify mitophagy. MitoTracker has emerged as a useful tool in evaluating mitophagy. Mitochondrial potential-independent MitoTracker is able to stain live mitochondria and enables demonstration of colocalization of mitochondria and autophagosome or lysosome with the aid of corresponding marker (Klionsky et al., 2012). Alternatively, since MitotTracker Green has been used to represent mitochondrial mass (Agnello et al., 2008; Cottet-Rousselle et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011) and a decrease in MitotTracker intensity may indicate the degradation of mitochondria, it has been widely utilized to evaluate mitophagy (Kundu et al., 2008; Valentin-Vega et al., 2012). Recently, a flow cytometry-based approach to determine mitophagy by using MitoTracker Deep Red has been introduced by Mauro-Lizcano et al. (2015). Despite the promising role of MitoTracker, we would like to highlight potential limitations in its interpretation as some factors may significantly affect determination of mitochondrial mass by MitoTracker staining. First, MitoTracker Deep Red is actually a mitochondrial potential-dependent dye though this is usually not highlighted in the manufacturer's manual. It has been used as an index for mitochondrial potential (Lugli et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2011; Greene et al., 2012). Our data also suggest that the intensity of MitoTracker Deep Red changes along with mitochondrial potential. Mitochondrial depolarization induced by carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) treatment decreased fluorescence intensity of MitoTracker Deep Red, while starvation induced by Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) treatment increased fluorescence intensity of MitoTracker Deep Red (Figure 1A). JC-1 assay utilized in our experiments confirmed that CCCP disrupted mitochondrial potential and revealed that EBSS treatment caused mitochondrial potential to increase (Figure 1B), in line with the report that amino acid starvation raised mitochondrial potential (Johnson et al., 2014). Our data and previous reports suggest that MitoTracker Deep Red is a mitochondrial potential-dependent dye and therefore should not be used to quantitatively assess mitophagy. MitoTracker Green has been widely utilized to represent the mitochondrial mass (Agnello et al., 2008; Cottet-Rousselle et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011). Notwithstanding, we found that EBSS treatment caused increment in the intensity of MitoTracker Green, indicating MitoTracker Green staining might also be affected by mitochondrial potential (Figure 1C). Unexpectedly, our data showed that its intensity increased with CCCP treatment which depolarizes mitochondria (Figure 1C). As CCCP treatment leads to mitochondrial depolarization and reactive},

abstract = {TDP-43 is a multifunctional DNA/RNA-binding protein that has been identified as the major component of the cytoplasmic ubiquitin (+) inclusions (UBIs) in diseased cells of frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Unfortunately, effective drugs for these neurodegenerative diseases are yet to be developed. We have tested the therapeutic potential of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and three other autophagy activators (spermidine, carbamazepine, and tamoxifen) in a FTLD-U mouse model with TDP-43 proteinopathies. Rapamycin treatment has been reported to be beneficial in some animal models of neurodegenerative diseases but not others. Furthermore, the effects of rapamycin treatment in FTLD-U have not been investigated. We show that rapamycin treatment effectively rescues the learning/memory impairment of these mice at 3 mo of age, and it significantly slows down the age-dependent loss of their motor function. These behavioral improvements upon rapamycin treatment are accompanied by a decreased level of caspase-3 and a reduction of neuron loss in the forebrain of FTLD-U mice. Furthermore, the number of cells with cytosolic TDP-43 (+) inclusions and the amounts of full-length TDP-43 as well as its cleavage products (35 kDa and 25 kDa) in the urea-soluble fraction of the cellular extract are significantly decreased upon rapamycin treatment. These changes in TDP-43 metabolism are accompanied by rapamycin-induced decreases in mTOR-regulated phospho-p70 S6 kinase (P-p70) and the p62 protein, as well as increases in the autophagic marker LC3. Finally, rapamycin as well as spermidine, carbamazepine, and tamoxifen could also rescue the motor dysfunction of 7-mo-old FTLD-U mice. These data suggest that autophagy activation is a potentially useful route for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases with TDP-43 proteinopathies.},

abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin. There are no treatments that are known to slow the neurodegeneration caused by this mutation. Mutant huntingtin causes disease via a toxic gain-of-function mechanism and has the propensity to aggregate and form intraneuronal inclusions. One therapeutic approach for HD is to enhance the degradation of the mutant protein. We have shown that this can be achieved by upregulating autophagy, using the drug rapamycin. In order to find safer ways of inducing autophagy for clinical purposes, we previously screened United States Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for their autophagy-stimulating potential. This screen suggested that rilmenidine, a well tolerated, safe, centrally acting anti-hypertensive drug, could induce autophagy in cell culture via a pathway that was independent of the mammalian target of rapamycin. Here we have shown that rilmenidine induces autophagy in mice and in primary neuronal culture. Rilmenidine administration attenuated the signs of disease in a HD mouse model and reduced levels of the mutant huntingtin fragment. As rilmenidine has a long safety record and is designed for chronic use, our data suggests that it should be considered for the treatment of HD and related conditions.},

Sequestration of mTOR impairs its kinase activity and induces autophagy, a key clearance pathway for mutant huntingtin fragments. This protects against polyglutamine toxicity, as the specific mTOR inhibitor rapamycin attenuates huntingtin accumulation and cell death in cell models of Huntington disease, and inhibition of autophagy has the converse effects. Furthermore, rapamycin protects against neurodegeneration in a fly model of Huntington disease, and the rapamycin analog CCI-779 improved performance on four different behavioral tasks and decreased aggregate formation in a mouse model of Huntington disease.

This review concentrates on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as it is a more stable ROS, and delineates its role as a survival molecule. In the first part, the production of H2O2 through the NADPH oxidase (Nox) family is investigated. Through careful examination of Nox proteins and their regulation, it is determined how they respond to stress and how this can be prosurvival rather than prodeath. The pathways on which H2O2 acts to enable its prosurvival function are then examined in greater detail. The main survival pathways are kinase driven, and oxidation of cysteines in the active sites of various phosphatases can thus regulate those survival pathways. Regulation of transcription factors such as p53, NF-$\kappa$B, and AP-1 also are reviewed. Finally, prodeath proteins such as caspases could be directly inhibited through their cystei...},

Recent evidence indicates that autophagy can regulate macrophage M1/M2 polarization under different inflammatory conditions. Polyamines, including putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (SPM), are polycations with anti-oxidative, anti-aging, and cell autophagy induction properties. This study aimed to determine the mechanisms by which SPM protects against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced acute liver injury in a mouse model. Pretreatment with SPM significantly alleviated liver injury and reduced intrahepatic inflammation in TAA-induced liver injury compared to controls. SPM markedly inhibited M1 polarization, but promoted M2 polarization of KCs obtained from TAA-exposed livers, as evidenced by decreased IL-1$\beta$ and iNOS gene induction but increased Arg-1 and Mrc-1 gene induction accompanied by decreased STAT1 activation and increased STAT6 activation. Furthermore, pretreatment with SPM enhanced autophagy, as revealed by increased LC3B-II levels, decreased p62 protein expression, and increased ATG5 protein expression in TAA-treated KCs. Knockdown of ATG5 in SPM-pretreated KCs by siRNA resulted in a significant increase in pro-inflammatory TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6 secretion and decreased anti-inflammatory IL-10 secretion after TAA treatment, while no significant changes were observed in cytokine production in the TAA treatment alone. Additionally, the effect of SPM on regulation of KC M1/M2 polarization was abolished by ATG5 knockdown in TAA-exposed KCs. Finally, in vivo ATG5 knockdown in KCs abrogated the protective effect of SPM against TAA-induced acute liver injury. Our results indicate that SPM-mediated autophagy inhibits M1 polarization, while promoting M2 polarization of KCs in TAA-treated livers via upregulation of ATG5 expression, leading to attenuated liver injury. This study provides a novel target for the prevention of acute liver injury.},

abstract = {Background: Although oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, data found in the literature are still a matter of controversy. Objective: To study lipid peroxidation and nitrite plus nitrate levels in brain specimens (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices) from 8 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in comparison to 6 young and 7 age-matched controls. Methods: Lipid peroxidation was estimated by the thiobarbiturate test for malonaldehyde and nitrate/nitrite using the Griess method. Results: Our results show a clear malonaldehyde increase tendency in all brain areas from AD cases in relation to older individuals and younger controls. In temporal cortex there was no difference between AD cases and age-matched controls. We suggest that this may be due to incipient temporal cortex damage in control individuals and that this area could be more susceptible to age-related changes. We showed that nitrite plus nitrate levels significantly decrease in brain areas of AD cases in relation to young controls. Except for the frontal cortex, there was a trend for a decreased concentration of nitrite/nitrate in the aged group in all brain areas studied as compared with young controls. Conclusion: Our results support a major role for lipid peroxidation alterations in cerebral cortex of AD patients and showed not only a decrease in nitrite/nitrate levels in frontal cortex of AD cases in relation to young and old individuals, but also a reduction in these nitric oxide metabolites in the other cortical areas as related to young controls.

Although the primary role of autophagy in many organisms is in adaptation to starvation, autophagy is also thought to be important for normal turnover of cytoplasmic contents, particularly in quiescent cells such as neurons. Autophagy may have a protective role against the development of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we report that loss of autophagy causes neurodegeneration even in the absence of any disease-associated mutant proteins. Mice deficient for Atg5 (autophagy-related 5) specifically in neural cells develop progressive deficits in motor function that are accompanied by the accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons. In Atg5-/- cells, diffuse, abnormal intracellular proteins accumulate, and then form aggregates and inclusions. These results suggest that the continuous clearance of diffuse cytosolic proteins through basal autophagy is important for preventing the accumulation of abnormal proteins, which can disrupt neural function and ultimately lead to neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: USES: Diquat (1,1'-ethylene-2,2'-bipyridilium) is a nonselective bipyridyl herbicide, related structurally to paraquat, which is used both as a contact herbicide and a preharvest desiccant. In comparison to paraquat, diquat is used much less widely in agriculture. MECHANISMS OF TOXICITY: Diquat is a potent redox cycler and is readily converted to a free radical which, in reaction with molecular oxygen, generates superoxide anions and subsequently other redox products. These products can induce lipid peroxidation in cell membranes, and potentially cause cell death. FEATURES: Over the period 1968-1999, only 30 cases of diquat poisoning were reported in detail in the literature, of which 13 (43{\%}) were fatal. Local and systemic effects have been reported following diquat exposure, with systemic features being invariably associated with ingestion. In severe and usually fatal cases, gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration, paralytic ileus, hypovolemic shock, acute renal failure, and coma have been reported. MANAGEMENT: After rapid confirmation of the diagnosis using a qualitative urine test, gut decontamination may be considered in patients who present within 1 hour of a life-threatening ingestion ({\textgreater}6 g). Supportive measures including fluid and electrolyte replacement should then be employed. Although hemofiltration and hemodialysis are of proven value if renal failure supervenes, there is no clinical evidence that hemodialysis or hemoperfusion removes toxicologically significant amounts of diquat, thereby reducing the risk of organ failure and preventing a fatal outcome in severe cases.},

abstract = {The ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) protein has recently been proposed to play critical roles in the response to mitochondrial dysfunction by initiating mitophagy. Here, we have used ATM-proficient GM00637 cells and ATM-deficient GM05849 cells to investigate the mitophagic effect of spermidine and to elucidate the role of ATM in spermdine-induced mitophagy. Our results indicate that spermidine induces mitophagy by eliciting mitochondrial depolarization, which triggers the formation of mitophagosomes and mitolysosomes, thereby promoting the accumulation of PINK1 and translocation of Parkin to damaged mitochondria, finally leading to the decreased mitochondrial mass in GM00637 cells. However, in GM05849 cells or GM00637 cells pretreated with the ATM kinase inhibitor KU55933, the expression of full-length PINK1 and the translocation of Parkin are blocked, and the colocalization of Parkin with either LC3 or PINK1 is disrupted. These results suggest that ATM drives the initiation of the mitophagic cascade. Our study demonstrates that spermidine induces mitophagy through ATM-dependent activation of the PINK1/Parkin pathway. These findings underscore the importance of a mitophagy regulatory network of ATM and PINK1/Parkin and elucidate a novel mechanism by which ATM influences spermidine-induced mitophagy.},

abstract = {Ischemic cell injury leads to cell death. Three main morphologies have been described: apoptosis, cell death with autophagy and necrosis. Their inherent dynamic nature, a point of no return (PONR) and molecular overlap have been stressed. The relationship between a defined cell death type and the severity of injury remains unclear. The functional role of autophagy and its effects on cell death onset is largely unknown. In this study we report a differential induction of cell death, which is dependent on the severity and duration of an ischemic insult. We show that mild ischemia leads to the induction of autophagy and apoptosis, while moderate or severe ischemia induces both apoptotic and necrotic cell death without increased autophagy. The autophagic response during mild injury was associated with an ATP surge. Real-time imaging and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) revealed that increased autophagy delays the PONR of both apoptosis and necrosis significantly. Blocking autophagy shifted PONR to an earlier point in time. Our results suggest that autophagic activity directly alters intracellular metabolic parameters, responsible for maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular membrane integrity. A similar treatment also improved functional recovery in the perfused rat heart. Taken together, we demonstrate a novel finding: autophagy is implicated only in mild injury and positions the PONR in cell death. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Inhibition of polyglutamine-induced protein aggregation could provide treatment options for polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington disease. Here we showed through in vitro screening studies that various disaccharides can inhibit polyglutamine-mediated protein aggregation. We also found that various disaccharides reduced polyglutamine aggregates and increased survival in a cellular model of Huntington disease. Oral administration of trehalose, the most effective of these disaccharides, decreased polyglutamine aggregates in cerebrum and liver, improved motor dysfunction and extended lifespan in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington disease. We suggest that these beneficial effects are the result of trehalose binding to expanded polyglutamines and stabilizing the partially unfolded polyglutamine-containing protein. Lack of toxicity and high solubility, coupled with efficacy upon oral administration, make trehalose promising as a therapeutic drug or lead compound for the treatment of polyglutamine diseases. The saccharide-polyglutamine interaction identified here thus provides a new therapeutic strategy for polyglutamine diseases.},

Copolymerizations and terpolymerizations of N-carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) of glycine (Gly), N$\delta$-carbobenzyloxy-l-ornithine (Z-Orn), and $\beta$-benzyl-l-aspartate (Bz-Asp) were investigated. In situ1H NMR spectroscopy was used to monitor individual comonomer consumptions during binary and ternary copolymerizations. The six relevant reactivity ratios were determined from copolymerizations of the NCAs of amino acids via nonlinear least-squares curve fitting. The reactivity ratios were subsequently used to maximize the occurrence of the Asp-Gly-Orn (DGR′) sequence in the terpolymers. Terpolymers with variable probability of occurrence of DGR′ were prepared in the lab. Subsequently, the ornithine residues on the terpolymers were converted to l-arginine (R) residues via guanidination reaction after removal of the protecting groups. The resulting DGR terpolymers translate to traditional peptides and proteins with variable RGD content, due to the convention in nomenclature that peptides are depicted from N- to C-terminus, whereas the NCA ring-opening polymerization is conducted from C- to N-terminus. The l-arginine containing terpolymers were evaluated for cell interaction, where it was found that neuronal cells display enhanced adhesion and process formation when plated in the presence of statistical DGR terpolymers.},

Means and SD of CSF levels of GFAP for the young control group (from 1 to 25 years, mean +/- SD 14.2 +/- 5.0, n = 13) adult control (from 26 to 55 years, 41.6 +/- 10.1, n = 9) and senescent control (older than 56 years, 65.4 +/- 8.0, n = 8) were 2.96 +/- 1.04, 2.80 +/- 1.46 and 3.99 +/- 1.55 ng/ml, respectively, and the CSF level of GFAP was not dependent on age (ANOVA, p = 0.17). While that of the AD patient group (n = 27, 70.8 +/- 8.0 years) was 8.96 +/- 7.80 ng/ml, significantly higher than that of both the all-control (3.19 +/- 1.39 ng/ml, t test, p {\textless} 0.001) and age-matched senescent (3.99 +/- 1.55 ng/ml, t test, p {\textless} 0.005) control groups. The receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the GFAP concentration at 5 ng/ml in CSF could serve as a cutoff value. The CSF level of GFAP in the moderately to severely demented patients (MMSE {\textless}/= 17, 13.2 +/- 9.10 ng/ml, n = 9) was approximately by two-fold higher than that of the mildly to moderately demented patients (MMSE {\textgreater}/= 18, 6.85 +/- 5.76 ng/ml, n = 18; ANOVA, p {\textless} 0.05).

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor {\&} Francis. Macroautophagy/autophagy is the main intracellular catabolic pathway in neurons that eliminates misfolded proteins, aggregates and damaged organelles associated with ageing and neurodegeneration. Autophagy is regulated by both MTOR-dependent and -independent pathways. There is increasing evidence that autophagy is compromised in neurodegenerative disorders, which may contribute to cytoplasmic sequestration of aggregation-prone and toxic proteins in neurons. Genetic or pharmacological modulation of autophagy to promote clearance of misfolded proteins may be a promising therapeutic avenue for these disorders. Here, we demonstrate robust autophagy induction in motor neuronal cells expressing SOD1 or TARDBP/TDP-43 mutants linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Treatment of these cells with rilmenidine, an anti-hypertensive agent and imidazoline-1 receptor agonist that induces autophagy, promoted autophagic clearance of mutant SOD1 and efficient mitophagy. Rilmenidine administration to mutant SOD1 G93A mice upregulated autophagy and mitophagy in spinal cord, leading to reduced soluble mutant SOD1 levels. Importantly, rilmenidine increased autophagosome abundance in motor neurons of SOD1 G93A mice, suggesting a direct action on target cells. Despite robust induction of autophagy in vivo, rilmenidine worsened motor neuron degeneration and symptom progression in SOD1 G93A mice. These effects were associated with increased accumulation and aggregation of insoluble and misfolded SOD1 species outside the autophagy pathway, and severe mitochondrial depletion in motor neurons of rilmenidine-treated mice. These findings suggest that rilmenidine treatment may drive disease progression and neurodegeneration in this mouse model due to excessive mitophagy, implying that alternative strategies to beneficially stimulate autophagy are warranted in ALS.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PQ-induced lung toxicity still need to be elucidated. Here, we found that PQ significantly decreases cell viability, increases sub-G1 hypodiploids DNA contents and caspase 3/7 activity in lung alveolar epithelial cell-derived L2 cells, which also caused mitochondrial dysfunction, and decreased the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and increased that of Bax, Bak, and p53. Moreover, the protein expressions of Bax and Bak were increased in PQ-treated cells. In addition, when PQ was exposed to L2 cells, the expressions of ER stress-related signaling genes (including Grp78, CHOP, and caspase-12 mRNA) and proteins (including phospho-eIF-2$\alpha$, CHOP, Grp78, calpain I and -II, and caspase-12) were significantly increased. PQ also decreased the protein expressions of pro-caspase-9/7/3. Next, we investigated the role of Nrf-2 in PQ-induced alveolar epithelial cell toxicity. In L2 cells, PQ induced Nrf-2 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. Cells transfected with Nrf-2 siRNA significantly reversed the PQ-induced toxicity, including depolarization of MMP, increased the Bax, Bak, p53 mRNAs expression, decreased the Bcl-2 mRNA expression, increased the caspase 3/7 activity, Grp78, CHOP, and caspase-12 mRNAs and protein expression, and decreased that of pro-caspase-3. Taken together, these results suggest that Nrf-2-regulated mitochondria and ER stress-related pathways are involved in the PQ-induced alveolar epithelial cell injury.},

This enzyme generates fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P(2)), the most potent activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (Pfk1; ref. 4), a master regulator of glycolysis. Here, we show that Pfkfb3 is absent from neurons in the brain cortex and that Pfkfb3 in neurons is constantly subject to proteasomal degradation by the action of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-Cdh1. By contrast, astrocytes have low APC/C-Cdh1 activity and therefore Pfkfb3 is present in these cells. Upregulation of Pfkfb3 by either inhibition of Cdh1 or overexpression of Pfkfb3 in neurons resulted in the activation of glycolysis. This, however, was accompanied by a marked decrease in the oxidation of glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway (a metabolic route involved in the regeneration of reduced glutathione) resulting in oxidative stress and apoptotic death. Thus, by actively downregulating glycolysis by APC/C-Cdh1, neurons use glucose to maintain their antioxidant status at the expense of its utilization for bioenergetic purposes.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a regulated process of intracellular catabolism required for normal cellular maintenance, as well as serving as an adaptive response under various stress conditions, including starvation. The molecular regulation of autophagy in mammalian cells remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate a role for protein acetylation in the execution and regulation of autophagy. In particular, we demonstrate that the p300 acetyltransferase can regulate the acetylation of various known components of the autophagy machinery. Knockdown of p300 reduces acetylation of Atg5, Atg7, Atg8, and Atg12, although overexpressed p300 increases the acetylation of these same proteins. Furthermore, p300 and Atg7 colocalize within cells, and the two proteins physically interact. The interaction between p300 and Atg7 is dependent on nutrient availability. Finally, we demonstrate that knockdown of p300 can stimulate autophagy, whereas overexpression of p300 inhibits starvation-induced autophagy. These results demonstrate a role for protein acetylation and particularly p300 in the regulation of autophagy under conditions of limited nutrient availability.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of aggregates (Lewy bodies) in neurons. alpha-Synuclein is the major protein in Lewy bodies and rare mutations in alpha-synuclein cause early-onset PD. Consequently, alpha-synuclein is implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Here, we have investigated the degradation pathways of alpha-synuclein, using a stable inducible PC12 cell model, where the expression of exogenous human wild-type, A30P, or A53T alpha-synuclein can be switched on and off. We have used a panel of inhibitors/stimulators of autophagy and proteasome function and followed alpha-synuclein degradation in these cells. We found that not only is alpha-synuclein degraded by the proteasome, but it is also degraded by autophagy. A role for autophagy was further supported by the presence of alpha-synuclein in organelles with the ultrastructural features of autophagic vesicles. Since rapamycin, a stimulator of autophagy, increased clearance of alpha-synuclein, it merits consideration as a potential therapeutic for Parkinsons disease, as it is designed for chronic use in humans.},

abstract = {Pesticide exposure is a risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about how pesticide exposure may promote AD pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of paraquat pesticide exposure on ␤-amyloid (A␤) levels and cognition using wild-type (WT) mice and ␤-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. Our results showed that wild-type mice and APP transgenic mice after paraquat exposure had increased oxidative damage specifically in mitochondria of cerebral cortex and exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the elevated mitochondrial damage was directly correlated with impaired associative learning and memory and increased A␤ levels in APP transgenic mice exposed to paraquat. Furthermore, overexpression of peroxiredoxin 3, a mitochondrial antioxidant defense enzyme important for H2 O2 removal, protected against paraquat-induced mitochondrial damage and concomitantly improved cognition and decreased A␤levels in APP transgenic mice. Therefore, our results demonstrate that mitochondrial damage is a key mechanism underlying cognitive impairment and elevated amyloidogenesis induced by paraquat and that enhanced removal of mitochon- drial H2 O2 could be an effective strategy to ameliorate AD pathogenesis induced by pesticide exposure.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence support the role of oxidative stress, including increased lipid peroxidation, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lipid peroxidation generates various reactive aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), which have been detected immunochemically in AD, particularly in neurofibrillary tangles, one of the major diagnostic lesions in AD brains. A recent study demonstrated that acrolein, the most reactive among the $\alpha$, $\beta$-unsaturated aldehyde products of lipid peroxidation, could be rapidly incorporated into proteins, generating a carbonyl derivative, a marker of oxidative stress to proteins. The current studies used an antibody raised against acrolein-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to test whether acrolein modification of proteins occurs in AD. Double immunofluorescence revealed strong acrolein-KLH immunoreactivity in more than half of all paired helical filament (PHF)-1-labeled neurofibrillary tangles in AD cases. Acrolein-KLH immunoreactivity was also evident in a few neurons lacking PHF-1-positive neurofibrillary tangles. Light acrolein-KLH immunoreactivity occurred in dystrophic neurites surrounding the amyloid-$\beta$ core, which itself lacked acrolein-KLH staining. The pattern of acrolein-KLH immunostaining was similar to that of HNE. Control brains did not contain any acrolein-KLH-immunoreactive structures. The current results suggest that protein-bound acrolein is a powerful marker of oxidative damage to protein and support the hypothesis that lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage to protein may play a crucial role in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and to neuronal death in AD.},

abstract = {Autophagy was first discovered by transmission electron microscopy more than 50 years ago. For decades, electron microscopy was the only way to reliably detect autophagic compartments in cells because no specific protein markers were known. In the 1970s, however, the introduction of biochemical methods enabled quantitative studies of autophagic-lysosomal degradation, and in the 1980s specific biochemical assays for autophagic sequestration became available. Since the identification of autophagy-related genes in the 1990s, combined fluorescence microscopy, biochemical and genetic methods have taken the leading role in autophagy research. However, electron microscopy is still needed to confirm and verify results obtained by other methods, and also to produce novel knowledge that would not be achievable by any other experimental approach. Confocal microscopy, with its ever-improving resolution, is probably the best-suited morphological approach to investigate the dynamic aspects of autophagy. However, for analyzing the ultrastructural details of the many novel organelles and mechanisms involved in specific subtypes of autophagy, the electron microscope is still indispensable. This review will summarize the impact that electron microscopy has had on autophagy research sinc e the discovery of this self-degradation process in the mid-1950s. Astonishingly, some of the "novel" concepts and principles of autophagy, presented in the recent studies, were already proposed several decades ago by the pioneering, accurate and passionate work of virtuoso electron microscopists. {\textcopyright} 2011 Landes Bioscience.},

The distribution pattern and packing density of amyloid deposits turned out to be of limited significance for differentiation of neuropathological stages. Neurofibrillary changes occurred in the form of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. The distribution of neuritic plaques varied widely not only within architectonic units but also from one individual to another. Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, in contrast, exhibited a characteristic distribution pattern permitting the differentiation of six stages. The first two stages were characterized by an either mild or severe alteration of the transentorhinal layer Pre-alpha (transentorhinal stages I-II). The two forms of limbic stages (stages III-IV) were marked by a conspicuous affection of layer Pre-alpha in both transentorhinal region and proper entorhinal cortex. In addition, there was mild involvement of the first Ammon's horn sector. The hallmark of the two isocortical stages (stages V-VI) was the destruction of virtually all isocortical association areas. The investigation showed that recognition of the six stages required qualitative evaluation of only a few key preparations.},

abstract = {Lithium, a drug used to treat bipolar disorders, has a variety of neuroprotective mechanisms including inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a major tau kinase. Recently, it has been shown that, in various neurodegenerative proteinopathies, lithium could induce autophagy. To analyze how lithium is therapeutically beneficial in tauopathies, transgenic mice overexpressing human mutant tau (P301L) were treated with oral lithium chloride (LiCl) for 4. months starting at the age of 5. months. At first, we examined the effects of treatment on behavior (using a battery of behavioral tests), tau phosphorylation (by biochemical assays), and number of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (by immunohistopathology). In comparison with control mice, LiCl-treated mice showed a significantly better score in the sensory motor tasks, as well as decreases in tau phosphorylation, soluble tau level, and number of NFTs. Next, we examined lithium effects on autophagy using an antibody against microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) as an autophagosome marker. The number of LC3-positive autophagosome-like puncta was increased in neurons of LiCl-treated mice. Neurons containing NFTs were completely LC3-negative, whereas LC3-positive autophagosome-like puncta contained phosphorylated-tau (p-tau). The protein level of p62 was decreased in LiCl-treated mice. These data suggested that oral long-term lithium treatment could attenuate p-tau-induced motor disturbance not only by inhibiting GSK-3 but also by enhancing autophagy in tauopathy model mice. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Several trials testing the effects of physical activity, cognitive training, or antihypertensive interventions showed some evidence of efficacy on a primary cognitive endpoint. However, most of these trials had short follow-up periods, and further evidence is needed to confirm effectiveness and establish the optimum design or dose of interventions and ideal target populations.

Abnormal protein aggregation and impaired protein degradation pathways may contribute to the disease pathogenesis. Although it has been reported that autophagy is altered in patients and animal model of ALS, little is known about the role of autophagy in motor neuron degeneration in this disease. Our previous study shows that rapamycin, an MTOR-dependent autophagic activator, accelerates disease progression in the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of ALS. In the present report, we have assessed the role of the MTOR-independent autophagic pathway in ALS by determining the effect of the MTOR-independent autophagic inducer trehalose on disease onset and progression, and on motor neuron degeneration in SOD1(G93A) mice. We have found that trehalose significantly delays disease onset prolongs life span, and reduces motor neuron loss in the spinal cord of SOD1(G93A) mice. Most importantly, we have documented that trehalose decreases SOD1 and SQSTM1/p62 aggregation, reduces ubiquitinated protein accumulation, and improves autophagic flux in the motor neurons of SOD1(G93A) mice. Moreover, we have demonstrated that trehalose can reduce skeletal muscle denervation, protect mitochondria, and inhibit the proapoptotic pathway in SOD1(G93A) mice. Collectively, our study indicated that the MTOR-independent autophagic inducer trehalose is neuroprotective in the ALS model and autophagosome-lysosome fusion is a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of ALS.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether hippocampal neurons and choroidal epithelial cells demonstrate a mitochondrial enzyme deficiency in AD more frequently than in normal aging. Background: High levels of mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause a deficiency in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) (complex IV activity) because three of its 13 subunits are encoded for by mtDNA. In contrast, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (complex II activity) remains intact because all of its subunits are nuclear encoded. The histologic hallmark of cells containing high levels of mtDNA mutation in both primary mtDNA disorders and normal aging muscle is the presence of COX-deficient SDH-positive cells. Methods: The authors applied a sequential histochemical method for COX and SDH to hippocampal sections in 17 AD and 17 age-matched control brains. This confers the advantages of both looking at individual cells in situ and measuring the actual mitochondrial complex activity rather than simply the complex quantity. Results: COX-deficient SDH-positive hippocampal neurons and choroidal epithelial cells are more prevalent in patients with AD than in controls. In addition the COX-deficient SDH-positive choroidal cells are associated with an enlargement in size. Conclusion: This increase in number of COX-deficient SDH-positive hippocampal pyramidal neurons and choroid epithelial cells provides strong evidence that a substantial mitochondrial enzyme activity defect occurs in individual cells more frequently in AD than in normal aging and that mitochondria may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD.},

abstract = {The accumulation of lysosomes and their hydrolases within neurons is a well-established neuropathologic feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). Here we show that lysosomal pathology in AD brain involves extensive alterations of macroautophagy, an inducible pathway for the turnover of intracellular constituents, including organelles. Using immunogold labeling with compartmental markers and electron microscopy on neocortical biopsies from AD brain, we unequivocally identified autophagosomes and other prelysosomal autophagic vacuoles (AVs), which were morphologically and biochemically similar to AVs highly purified from mouse liver. AVs were uncommon in brains devoid of AD pathology but were abundant in AD brains particularly, within neuritic processes, including synaptic terminals. In dystrophic neurites, autophagosomes, multivesicular bodies, multilamellar bodies, and cathepsin-containing autophagolysosomes were the predominant organelles and accumulated in large numbers. These compartments were distinguishable from lysosomes and lysosomal dense bodies, previously shown also to be abundant in dystrophic neurites. Autophagy was evident in the perikarya of affected neurons, particularly in those with neurofibrillary pathology where it was associated with a relative depletion of mitochondria and other organelles. These observations provide the first evidence that macroautophagy is extensively involved in the neurodegenerative/regenerative process in AD. The striking accumulations of immature AV forms in dystrophic neurites suggest that the transport of AVs and their maturation to lysosomes may be impaired, thereby impeding the suspected neuroprotective functions of autophagy.},

abstract = {Paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride) is widely used as a redox cycler to stimulate superoxide production in organisms, cells, and mitochondria. This superoxide production causes extensive mitochondrial oxidative damage, however, there is considerable uncertainty over the mitochondrial sites of paraquat reduction and superoxide formation. Here we show that in yeast and mammalian mitochondria, superoxide production by paraquat occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, as inferred from manganese superoxide dismutase-sensitive mitochondrial DNA damage, as well as from superoxide assays in isolated mitochondria, which were unaffected by exogenous superoxide dismutase. This paraquat-induced superoxide production in the mitochondrial matrix required a membrane potential that was essential for paraquat uptake into mitochondria. This uptake was of the paraquat dication, not the radical monocation, and was carrier-mediated. Experiments with disrupted mitochondria showed that once in the matrix paraquat was principally reduced by complex I (mammals) or by NADPH dehydrogenases (yeast) to form the paraquat radical cation that then reacted with oxygen to form superoxide. Together this membrane potential-dependent uptake across the mitochondrial inner membrane and the subsequent rapid reduction to the paraquat radical cation explain the toxicity of paraquat to mitochondria.},

abstract = {Impaired degradation of amyloid beta (A??) peptides could lead to A?? accumulation, an early trigger of Alzheimer's disease (AD). How A??-degrading enzymes are regulated remains largely unknown. Cystatin C (CysC, CST3) is an endogenous inhibitor of cysteine proteases, including cathepsin B (CatB), a recently discovered A??-degrading enzyme. A CST3 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of late-onset sporadic AD. Here, we identified CysC as the key inhibitor of CatB-induced A?? degradation in??vivo. Genetic ablation of CST3 in hAPP-J20 mice significantly lowered soluble A?? levels, the relative abundance of A??1-42, and plaque load. CysC removal also attenuated A??-associated cognitive deficits and behavioral abnormalities and restored synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Importantly, the beneficial effects of CysC reduction were abolished on a CatB null background, providing direct evidence that CysC regulates soluble A?? and A??-associated neuronal deficits through inhibiting CatB-induced A?? degradation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid plaques are surrounded by reactive astrocytes with an increased expression of intermediate filaments including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Different GFAP isoforms have been identified that are differentially expressed by specific subpopulations of astrocytes and that impose different properties to the intermediate filament network. We studied transcript levels and protein expression patterns of all known GFAP isoforms in human hippocampal AD tissue at different stages of the disease. Ten different transcripts for GFAP isoforms were detected at different abundancies. Transcript levels of most isoforms increased with AD progression. GFAP$\delta$-immunopositive astrocytes were observed in subgranular zone, hilus, and stratum-lacunosum-moleculare. GFAP$\delta$-positive cells also stained for GFAP$\alpha$. In AD donors, astrocytes near plaques displayed increased staining of both GFAP$\alpha$ and GFAP$\delta$. The reading-frame-shifted isoform, GFAP+1, staining was confined to a subset of astrocytes with long processes, and their number increased in the course of AD. In conclusion, the various GFAP isoforms show differential transcript levels and are upregulated in a concerted manner in AD. The GFAP+1 isoform defines a unique subset of astrocytes, with numbers increasing with AD progression. These data indicate the need for future exploration of underlying mechanisms concerning the functions of GFAP$\delta$ and GFAP+1 isoforms in astrocytes and their possible role in AD pathology. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Here, we show that lentiviral expression of $\alpha$-synuclein in the mouse SN leads to Abl activation (phosphorylation) and lentiviral Abl expression increases $\alpha$-synuclein levels, in agreement with Abl activation in PD brains. Administration of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib decreases Abl activity and ameliorates autophagic clearance of $\alpha$-synuclein in transgenic and lentiviral gene transfer models. Subcellular fractionation shows accumulation of $\alpha$-synuclein and hyper-phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) in autophagic vacuoles in $\alpha$-synuclein expressing brains, but nilotinib enhances protein deposition into the lysosomes. Nilotinib is used for adult leukemia treatment and it enters the brain within US Food and Drug Administration approved doses, leading to autophagic degradation of $\alpha$-synuclein, protection of SN neurons and amelioration of motor performance.

Autophagy induction with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin accelerates clearance of these toxic substrates. As rapamycin has nontrivial side effects, we screened FDA-approved drugs to identify new autophagy-inducing pathways. We found that L-type Ca2+channel antagonists, the K+ATPchannel opener minoxidil, and the Gisignaling activator clonidine induce autophagy. These drugs revealed a cyclical mTOR-independent pathway regulating autophagy, in which cAMP regulates IP3levels, influencing calpain activity, which completes the cycle by cleaving and activating Gs$\alpha$, which regulates cAMP levels. This pathway has numerous potential points where autophagy can be induced, and we provide proof of principle for therapeutic relevance in Huntington's disease using mammalian cell, fly and zebrafish models. Our data also suggest that insults that elevate intracytosolic Ca2+(like excitotoxicity) inhibit autophagy, thus retarding clearance of aggregate-prone proteins. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Some hypothesize that aging in humans is a cumulative process of macromolecular and mitochondrial damage starting years, even decades before any symptoms arise. Aging may begin when the rate of damage exceeds the rate of continual repair and turnover. Quality control for damaged mitochondria entails cellular digestion by mitophagy, a specialized kind of autophagy. Insufficient protective autophagy could cause damaged cellular components to accumulate over many years until they affect normal function in the cell. Alternatively, aging could be the result of overactive, pathologic autophagy. Current knowledge supports both hypotheses with conflicting data, depending on which stage of autophagy is examined. To distinguish these opposite hypotheses, two criteria need to be observed. First, is there a buildup of undigested waste that can be removed by stimulation of autophagy? Or second, if autophagy is overactive, does inhibition of autophagy rescue cell, organ and organism demise. Both of these are best determined by rate measures rather than measures at a single time point. Here, we review the generalized process of autophagy, with a focus on the limited information available for neuron mitophagy, aging, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In two mouse models, treatment with rapamycin abolishes the AD pathology and reverses memory deficits. As a working model, we hypothesize that insufficient protective autophagy accelerates both aging and AD pathology, possibly caused by defects in autophagosome fusion with lysosomes.},

abstract = {After inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase by nitric oxide, astrocytes maintain energy production by upregulating glycolysis--a response which does not seem to be available to neurons. Here, we show that in astrocytes, after inhibition of respiration by nitric oxide, there is a rapid, cyclic GMP-independent increase in the activity of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1), a master regulator of glycolysis, and an increase in the concentration of its most powerful positive allosteric activator, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P(2)). In neurons, nitric oxide failed to alter F2,6P(2) concentration or PFK1 activity. This failure could be accounted for by the much lower amount of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK2, the enzyme responsible for F2,6P(2) biosynthesis) in neurons. Indeed, full activation of neuronal PFK1 was achieved by adding cytosol from nitric oxide-treated astrocytes. Furthermore, using the small interfering RNA (siRNA) strategy, we demonstrated that the rapid activation of glycolysis by nitric oxide is dependent on phosphorylation of the energy charge-sensitive AMP-activated protein kinase, resulting in activation of PFK2 and protection of cells from apoptosis. Thus the virtual absence of PFK2 in neurons may explain their extreme sensitivity to energy depletion and degeneration.},

abstract = {Synaptic loss is one of the major features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates well with the degree of dementia. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) have been shown to mediate downstream effects of beta-amyloid (Abeta). NMDARs can trigger intracellular cascades via Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} entry, however also Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-independent (metabotropic) functions of NMDARs have been described. Here we show that transgenically produced Abeta as well as exogenously added synthetic Abeta oligomers induce dendritic spine loss and reductions in pre- and postsynaptic protein levels in slice cultures. Synaptic alterations were mitigated by blocking glutamate-binding to NMDARs using NMDAR-antagonist APV, but not by preventing ion-flux with Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-chelator BAPTA or open channel blocker MK-801 or memantine. Spine loss was mediated by active p38 MAPK. Abeta-induced p38 activation was reduced by APV but not by BAPTA, MK-801 or memantine treatment highlighting the role of glutamate binding to NMDAR but not Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-flux for synaptic degeneration. Our data suggest that Abeta-induced synaptic loss is signaled through metabotropic-like activation of NMDARs. This Ca{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-independent NMDAR signaling may represent a therapeutic target for drugs designed to reduce synaptic deficits in AD.},

abstract = {The effects of the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A (CsA), FK506 and rapamycin have been compared using murine B cells activated with a variety of mitogens. FK506 is a macrolide antibiotic that has been recently shown to inhibit T cell activation by a mechanism that appears similar to that of CsA. Rapamycin is a macrolide structurally related to FK506 whose mechanism of T cell suppression appears to be distinct from that of FK506 and CsA. While CsA and FK506 were found to preferentially inhibit B cell activation caused by stimuli which induce a rise in intracellular calcium, rapamycin partially inhibited activation by all stimuli tested, including those which are not associated with a calcium flux. All three compounds were found to inhibit cell cycle progression within the G1 phase; however, the rapamycin-sensitive event within G1 was completed earlier than the G1 events inhibited by CsA and FK506. In addition, inhibition of anti-IgM-activated B cells with CsA and FK506, but not with rapamycin, resulted in cell death. These data suggest that although CsA, FK506 and rapamycin are all inhibitors of B cell activation, the inhibitory activity of rapamycin can be clearly distinguished from that of CsA and FK506. Although the suppressive effects of CsA and FK506 on B cell proliferation were nearly identical in this study, their biological activities were distinguishable since FK506, but not CsA, could antagonize rapamycin-mediated suppression.},

In this study, we investigated the long-term effects of paraquat exposure on cognition of Alzheimer's disease animal model APP/PS1 mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Our results showed that APP/PS1 mice had exacerbated cognition impairment and elevated A$\beta$ levels at 5months after paraquat exposure, and that WT mice had cognition impairment at 5 and 16months after paraquat exposure. In addition, increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and augmented brain inflammation were observed in both paraquat-exposed APP/PS1 mice and WT mice.

Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing Prdx3, a key enzyme in detoxifying mitochondrial H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, had suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation, reduced brain inflammation, and attenuated cognition impairment after paraquat exposure.

abstract = {Objective: To assess regional patterns of gray and white matter atrophy in familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) mutation carriers.

Methods: A total of 192 participants with volumetric T1-weighted MRI, genotyping, and clinical diagnosis were available from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network. Of these, 69 were presymptomatic mutation carriers, 50 were symptomatic carriers (31 with Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] = 0.5, 19 with CDR {\textgreater} 0.5), and 73 were noncarriers from the same families. Voxel-based morphometry was used to identify cross-sectional group differences in gray matter and white matter volume.

Results: Significant differences in gray matter ( p {\textless} 0.05, family-wise error–corrected) were observed between noncarriers and mildly symptomatic (CDR = 0.5) carriers in the thalamus and putamen, as well as in the temporal lobe, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus; the same pattern, but with more extensive changes, was seen in those with CDR {\textgreater} 0.5. Significant white matter differences between noncarriers and symptomatic carriers were observed in the cingulum and fornix; these form input and output connections to the medial temporal lobe, cingulate, and precuneus. No differences between noncarriers and presymptomatic carriers survived correction for multiple comparisons, but there was a trend for decreased gray matter in the thalamus for carriers closer to their estimated age at onset. There were no significant increases of gray or white matter in asymptomatic or symptomatic carriers compared to noncarriers.

Conclusions: Atrophy in FAD is observed early, both in areas commonly associated with sporadic Alzheimer disease and also in the putamen and thalamus, 2 regions associated with early amyloid deposition in FAD mutation carriers.

Increased lipid peroxidation, decreased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and increased levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), F 2 -isoprostanes, and F 4 -neuroprostanes are present in the brain in AD. Acrolein, an $\alpha$,$\beta$-unsaturated aldehydic product of lipid peroxidation, is approximately 100 times more reactive than HNE and recently was demonstrated in neurofibrillary tangles in the brain in AD. In three brain regions of 10 AD patients compared with 8 age-matched control subjects, we found increased mean extractable acrolein, with the increases reaching statistical significance in the amygdala and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus. In hippocampal neuron cultures, acrolein was neurotoxic in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and more toxic than HNE at 5 $\mu$M concentrations of each. Acrolein exposure led to a significant concentration-dependent increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. Collectively, these data show that acrolein is increased in the brain in AD and demonstrate neurotoxicity mechanisms that might be important in the pathogenesis of neuron degeneration in AD. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {Systemic treatment of mice with the herbicide paraquat causes the selective loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, reproducing the primary neurodegenerative feature of Parkinson's disease. To elucidate the role of oxidative damage in paraquat neurotoxicity, the time-course of neurodegeneration was correlated to changes in 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), a lipid peroxidation marker. When mice were exposed to three weekly injections of paraquat, no nigral dopaminergic cell loss was observed after the first administration, whereas a significant reduction of neurons followed the second exposure. Changes in the number of nigral 4-HNE-positive neurons suggest a relationship between lipid peroxidation and neuronal death, since a dramatic increase in this number coincided with the onset and development of neurodegeneration after the second toxicant injection. Interestingly, the third paraquat administration did not cause any increase in 4-HNE-immunoreactive cells, nor did it produce any additional dopaminergic cell loss. Further evidence of paraquat-induced oxidative injury derives from the observation of nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra of paraquat-treated animals and from experiments with ferritin transgenic mice. These mice, which are characterized by a decreased susceptibility to oxidative stress, were completely resistant to the increase in 4-HNE-positive neurons and the cell death caused by paraquat. Thus, paraquat exposure yields a model that emphasizes the susceptibility of dopaminergic neurons to oxidative damage.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a major protein degradation pathway that is essential for stress-induced and constitutive protein turnover. Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that amyloid-beta (A beta) protein can be generated in autophagic vacuoles, promoting its extracellular deposition in neuritic plaques as the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The molecular machinery for A beta generation, including APP, APP-C99 and beta-/gamma-secretases, are all enriched in autophagic vacuoles. The induction of autophagy can be vividly observed in the brain at early stages of sporadic AD and in an AD transgenic mouse model. Accumulated evidence has also demonstrated a neuroprotective role of autophagy in mediating the degradation of aggregated proteins that are causative of various neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is thus widely regarded as an intracellular hub for the removal of the detrimental A beta peptides and Tau aggregates. Nonetheless, compelling data also reveal an unfavorable function of autophagy in facilitating the production of intracellular A beta. The two faces of autophagy on the homeostasis of A beta place it in a very unique and intriguing position in ADpathogenesis. This article briefly summarizes seminal discoveries that are shedding new light on the critical and unique roles of autophagy in AD and potential therapeutic approaches against autophagy-elicited AD.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group. Ischemic precondition plays a protective effect during cerebral ischemia. This effect partly depends on the autophagic activity. However, whether the activity of autophagy can exert the protective effects after cerebral ischemia is unclear. In this study, rats were treated with spermidine, an activator of autophagy, and injected with sodium laurate via the internal carotid artery to stimulate cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). The effects of the spermidine precondition on brain injury were evaluated by behavioural test, histology assay, ultrastructure observation, and autophagic-related signals. Furthermore, the mitochondria of brain tissue were isolated, and mitDNA were extracted. The stability of mitDNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Results showed that the penetrating artery of the striatum was damaged. This damage was accompanied by neural inflammation characterized by an increase in Fluoro-Jade C (FJC)-positive cells after sodium laurate injection. Spermidine pretreatment decreased the deletion of mitDNA and the autophagy hyperactivity induced by the laurate injection. Likewise, spermidine reduced the neurological deficit and FJC reactivation of striatum at 48 h after laurate injection. These results suggested sodium laurate injection through the internal carotid artery can induce the pathological features of CSVD characterized by the damage of penetrating artery, neurological deficit, mitochondrial impairment, and autophagic hyperactivity. Pretreatment with spermidine can ameliorate these outcomes. Further study indicated that the protective effect of the spermidine precondition is associated with the maintenance of mitochondrial stability and proper autophagy activity.},

We have examined the metabolism of APP in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding either wild-type human APP-695 or human APP-695 that harbors the Swedish double mutation associated with familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Although approximately 90{\%} of total soluble APP secreted from wild-type cells is secreted basolaterally following cleavage at the alpha-secretase site, soluble derivatives cleaved near or at the amino terminus of A beta (presumably the "beta-secretase" site) are preferentially secreted into the apical compartment of SWE cells. Concomitantly, levels of a specific A beta-containing carboxyl-terminal fragment are elevated in SWE cell lysates. Using domain-specific biotinylation and release assays, we failed to detect a beta-secretase-generated soluble derivative (APPs beta) released from the surface of SWE cells. However, APPs beta can be detected in SWE cell lysates, consistent with "beta-secretase" cleavage occurring in an intracellular compartment. Finally, we demonstrate that A beta is secreted into the basolateral compartment of SWE cells and that the majority of these A beta-related species contains an amino-terminal aspartate residue (+1).},

Autophagic flux is often defined as a measure of autophagic degradation activity, and many techniques exist to assess autophagic flux. Although these techniques have generated invaluable information about the autophagic system, the quest continues for developing methods that not only enhance sensitivity and provide a means of quantification, but also accurately reflect the dynamic character of the pathway. Based on the theoretical framework of metabolic control analysis, where the autophagosome flux is the quantitative description of the rate a flow along a pathway, here we treat the autophagy system as a multi-step pathway. We describe a single-cell fluorescence live-cell imaging-based approach that allows the autophagosome flux to be accurately measured. This method characterizes autophagy in terms of its complete autophagosome and autolysosome pool size, the autophagosome flux, J, and the transition time, $\tau$, for autophagosomes and autolysosomes at steady state. This approach provides a sensitive quantitative method to measure autophagosome flux, pool sizes and transition time in cells and tissues of clinical relevance.

Spermidine supplementation normalized aPWV, restored NO-mediated EDD and reduced nitrotyrosine, superoxide, AGEs and collagen in O. These effects of spermidine were associated with enhanced arterial expression of autophagy markers, and in vitro experiments demonstrated that vascular protection by spermidine was autophagy-dependent. Our results indicate that spermidine exerts a potent anti-aging influence on arteries by increasing NO bioavailability, reducing oxidative stress, modifying structural factors and enhancing autophagy.

abstract = {Autophagy is the sole pathway for organelle turnover in cells and is a vital pathway for degrading normal and aggregated proteins, particularly under stress or injury conditions. Recent evidence has shown that the amyloid beta peptide is generated from amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) during autophagic turnover of APP-rich organelles supplied by both autophagy and endocytosis. Abeta generated during normal autophagy is subsequently degraded by lysosomes. Within neurons, autophagosomes and endosomes actively form in synapses and along neuritic processes but efficient clearance of these compartments requires their retrograde transport towards the neuronal cell body, where lysosomes are most concentrated. In Alzheimer disease, the maturation of autophagolysosomes and their retrograde transport are impeded, which leads to a massive accumulation of ;autophagy intermediates' (autophagic vacuoles) within large swellings along dystrophic and degenerating neurites. The combination of increased autophagy induction and defective clearance of Abeta-generating autophagic vacuoles creates conditions favorable for Abeta accumulation in Alzheimer disease.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a complex and progressive neurodegenerative phenotype, with hypometabolism and impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics among the earliest pathogenic events. Bioenergetic deficits are well documented in preclinical models of mammalian aging and AD, emerge early in the prodromal phase of AD, and in those at risk for AD. This review discusses the importance of early therapeutic intervention during the prodromal stage that precedes irreversible degeneration in AD. Mechanisms of action for current mitochondrial and bioenergetic therapeutics for AD broadly fall into the following categories: 1) glucose metabolism and substrate supply; 2) mitochondrial enhancers to potentiate energy production; 3) antioxidants to scavenge reactive oxygen species and reduce oxidative damage; 4) candidates that target apoptotic and mitophagy pathways to either remove damaged mitochondria or prevent neuronal death. Thus far, mitochondrial therapeutic strategies have shown promise at the preclinical stage but have had little-to-no success in clinical trials. Lessons learned from preclinical and clinical therapeutic studies are discussed. Understanding the bioenergetic adaptations that occur during aging and AD led us to focus on a systems biology approach that targets the bioenergetic system rather than a single component of this system. Bioenergetic system-level therapeutics personalized to bioenergetic phenotype would target bioenergetic deficits across the prodromal and clinical stages to prevent and delay progression of AD.},

abstract = {Protein conformational disorders (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, are associated with proteins that misfold and aggregate. Here we have used exon 1 of the HD gene with expanded polyglutamine [poly(Q)] repeats and enhanced green fluorescent protein tagged to 19 alanines as models for aggregate-prone proteins, to investigate the pathways mediating their degradation. Autophagy is involved in the degradation of these model proteins, since they accumulated when cells were treated with different inhibitors acting at distinct stages of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, in two different cell lines. Furthermore, rapamycin, which stimulates autophagy, enhanced the clearance of our aggregate-prone proteins. Rapamycin also reduced the appearance of aggregates and the cell death associated with the poly(Q) and polyalanine [poly(A)] expansions. Since rapamycin is used clinically, this drug or related analogues may be suitable candidates for therapeutic investigation in HD and related diseases. We have also re-examined the role of the proteasome, since previous studies in poly(Q) diseases have used lactacystin as an inhibitor--recent studies have shown that lactacystin may also affect lysosomal function. Both lactacystin and the specific proteasomal inhibitor epoxomicin increased soluble protein levels of the poly(Q) constructs, suggesting that these are also cleared by the proteasome. However, while poly(Q) aggregation was enhanced by lactacystin in our inducible PC12 cell model, aggregation was reduced by epoxomicin, suggesting that some other protein(s) induced by epoxomicin may regulate poly(Q) aggregation.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a compensatory pathway involving isolation and subsequent degradation of cytosolic material and organelles in eukaryotic cells.(1) The autophagic process can provide a "housekeeping" function by removing damaged proteins and organelles in a selective or nonselective fashion in order to exert a protective effect following stress.(2) Remarkably, after being discovered to be much more of a targeted process than a random one, the role of autophagy became implicated in many normal cellular and disease processes.(3) Several methodologies are routinely employed to monitor the entire autophagic process.(4) Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3, a mammalian homolog of yeast Atg8, has been widely used as a specific marker to monitor autophagy in numerous cell types.(5) While monitoring autophagic flux is extremely important, it is also beneficial to perform a detailed analysis by electron microscopy (EM) to evaluate changes in various autophagic structures, quantify the areas involved, and determine if any particular organelle(s) or area of the cell cytoplasm is being targeted for degradation.(6) The following article describes methods to localize and quantify subcellular areas of autophagy using transmission EM. Also discussed are methods for subcellular localization of specific proteins by employing immunogold EM; this method becomes particularly useful in detecting early changes in cellular homeostasis that may occur before later signs of cellular insult can be observed morphologically.},

abstract = {Recently, we demonstrated a significant increase of an oxidized nucleoside derived from RNA, 8-hydroxyguanosine (8OHG), and an oxidized amino acid, nitrotyrosine in vulnerable neurons of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). To determine whether oxidative damage is an early- or end-stage event in the process of neurodegeneration in AD, we investigated the relationship between neuronal 8OHG and nitrotyrosine and histological and clinical variables, i.e. amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), as well as duration of dementia and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. Our findings show that oxidative damage is quantitatively greatest early in the disease and reduces with disease progression. Surprisingly, we found that increases in A beta deposition are associated with decreased oxidative damage. These relationships are more significant in ApoE epsilon4 carriers. Moreover, neurons with NFT show a 40{\%}-56{\%} decrease in relative 8OHG levels compared with neurons free of NFT. Our observations indicate that increased oxidative damage is an early event in AD that decreases with disease progression and lesion formation. These findings suggest that AD is associated with compensatory changes that reduce damage from reactive oxygen.},

abstract = {Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is the main astrocytic intermediate filament (IF). GFAP splice isoforms show differential expression patterns in the human brain. GFAP$\delta$ is preferentially expressed by neurogenic astrocytes in the subventricular zone (SVZ), whereas GFAP(+1) is found in a subset of astrocytes throughout the brain. In addition, the expression of these isoforms in human brain material of epilepsy, Alzheimer and glioma patients has been reported. Here, for the first time, we present a comprehensive study of GFAP isoform expression in both wild-type and Alzheimer Disease (AD) mouse models. In cortex, cerebellum, and striatum of wild-type mice, transcripts for Gfap-$\alpha$, Gfap-$\beta$, Gfap-$\gamma$, Gfap-$\delta$, Gfap-$\kappa$, and a newly identified isoform Gfap-$\zeta$, were detected. Their relative expression levels were similar in all regions studied. GFAP$\alpha$ showed a widespread expression whilst GFAP$\delta$ distribution was prominent in the SVZ, rostral migratory stream (RMS), neurogenic astrocytes of the subgranular zone (SGZ), and subpial astrocytes. In contrast to the human SVZ, we could not establish an unambiguous GFAP$\delta$ localization in proliferating cells of the mouse SVZ. In APPswePS1dE9 and 3xTgAD mice, plaque-associated reactive astrocytes had increased transcript levels of all detectable GFAP isoforms and low levels of a new GFAP isoform, Gfap-$\Delta$Ex7. Reactive astrocytes in AD mice showed enhanced GFAP$\alpha$ and GFAP$\delta$ immunolabeling, less frequently increased vimentin and nestin, but no GFAP$\kappa$ or GFAP(+1) staining. In conclusion, GFAP$\delta$ protein is present in SVZ, RMS, and neurogenic astrocytes of the SGZ, but also outside neurogenic niches. Furthermore, differential GFAP isoform expression is not linked with aging or reactive gliosis. This evidence points to the conclusion that differential regulation of GFAP isoforms is not involved in the reorganization of the IF network in reactive gliosis or in neurogenesis in the mouse brain.},

abstract = {Mutations in several genes, including Parkin, PTEN-induced kinase 1 (Pink1) and DJ-1, are associated with rare inherited forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite recent attention on the function of these genes, the interplay between DJ-1, Pink1 and Parkin in PD pathogenesis remains unclear. In particular, whether these genes regulate mitochondrial control pathways in neurons is highly controversial. Here we report that Pink1-dependent Parkin translocation does occur in mouse cortical neurons in response to a variety of mitochondrial damaging agents. This translocation only occurs in the absence of antioxidants in the neuronal culturing medium, implicating a key role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this response. Consistent with these observations, ROS blockers also prevent Parkin recruitment in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Loss of DJ-1, a gene linked to ROS management, results in increased stress-induced Parkin recruitment and increased mitophagy. Expression of wild-type DJ-1, but not a cysteine-106 mutant associated with defective ROS response, rescues this accelerated Parkin recruitment. Interestingly, DJ-1 levels increase at mitochondria following oxidative damage in both fibroblasts and neurons, and this process also depends on Parkin and possibly Pink1. These results not only highlight the presence of a Parkin/Pink1-mediated pathway of mitochondrial quality control (MQC) in neurons, they also delineate a complex reciprocal relationship between DJ-1 and the Pink1/Parkin pathway of MQC.},

Many of these mechanisms discovered so far have already been linked with aging and by acting on all of these mechanisms, polyamines may be strong regulators of aging.},

abstract = {Life span is regulated by genetic mechanisms as well as environmental or physiological factors. Neurons detect sensory cues from the environment and internal signals generated within the animal, and drive physiological, metabolic and behavioral changes that optimize fitness and survival of the organism. Recent studies, mainly based on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, suggest that the nervous system is instructive for aging and life span control. Chemosensation and thermosensation, as well as perception of other environmental cues, act upon specific neuronal types and influence life span via distinct secreted neuronal signals. In addition to sensory cues in the environment, neurons also respond to a wide range of external and internal stressors, and coordinate organismal-wide stress responses across different tissues. Life span extension is found in C. elegans strains whose systemic stress response is increased by genetic perturbation of mitochondrial respiration in the neurons, as well as in strains that overexpress the ER stress transcription factor XBP-1 in the nervous system. These observations support a model where the nervous system acts as a platform for life span control by integrating information from the environment and signals that report on the physiological states of the animal.},

abstract = {The accumulation of insoluble proteins is a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders. Tauopathies are caused by the dysfunction and aggregation of tau protein and an impairment of cellular protein degradation pathways may contribute to their pathogenesis. Thus, a deficiency in autophagy can cause neurodegeneration, while activation of autophagy is protective against some proteinopathies. Little is known about the role of autophagy in animal models of human tauopathy. In the present report, we assessed the effects of autophagy stimulation by trehalose in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, the human mutant P301S tau mouse, using biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. Neuronal survival was evaluated by stereology. Autophagy was activated in the brain, where the number of neurons containing tau inclusions was significantly reduced, as was the amount of insoluble tau protein. This reduction in tau aggregates was associated with improved neuronal survival in the cerebral cortex and the brainstem. We also observed a decrease of p62 protein, suggesting that it may contribute to the removal of tau inclusions. Trehalose failed to activate autophagy in the spinal cord, where it had no impact on the level of sarkosyl-insoluble tau. Accordingly, trehalose had no effect on the motor impairment of human mutant P301S tau transgenic mice. Our findings provide direct evidence in favour of the degradation of tau aggregates by autophagy. Activation of autophagy may be worth investigating in the context of therapies for human tauopathies.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a tightly regulated cell self-eating process. It has been shown to be associated with various neuropathological conditions and therefore, traditionally known as a stress-induced process. Recent studies, however, reveal that autophagy is constitutively active in healthy neurons. Neurons are highly specialized, post-mitotic cells that are typically composed of a soma (cell body), a dendritic tree, and an axon. Despite the vast growth of our current knowledge of autophagy, the detailed process in such a highly differentiated cell type remains elusive. Current evidence strongly suggests that autophagy is uniquely regulated in neurons and is also highly adapted to local physiology in the axons. In addition, the molecular mechanism for basal autophagy in neurons may be significantly divergent from "classical" induced autophagy. A considerable number of studies have increasingly shown an important role for autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases and have explored autophagy as a potential drug target. Thus, understanding the neuronal autophagy process will ultimately aid in drug target identification and rational design of drug screening to combat neurodegenerative diseases. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND In Alzheimer disease (AD), hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins results in microtubule destabilization and cytoskeletal abnormalities. Our prior ultra-morphometric studies documented a clear reduction in microtubules in pyramidal neurons in AD compared to controls, however, this reduction did not coincide with the presence of paired helical filaments. The latter suggests the presence of compensatory mechanism(s) that stabilize microtubule dynamics despite the loss of tau binding and stabilization. Microtubules are composed of tubulin dimers which are subject to posttranslational modifications that affect the stability and function of microtubules. METHODS In this study, we performed a detailed analysis on changes in the posttranslational modifications in tubulin in postmortem human brain tissues from AD patients and age-matched controls by immunoblot and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS Consistent with our previous study, we found decreased levels of $\alpha$-tubulin in AD brain. Levels of tubulin with various posttranslational modifications such as polyglutamylation, tyrosination, and detyrosination were also proportionally reduced in AD brain, but, interestingly, there was an increase in the proportion of the acetylated $\alpha$-tubulin in the remaining $\alpha$-tubulin. Tubulin distribution was changed from predominantly in the processes to be more accumulated in the cell body. The number of processes containing polyglutamylated tubulin was well preserved in AD neurons. While there was a cell autonomous detrimental effect of NFTs on tubulin, this is likely a gradual and slow process, and there was no selective loss of acetylated or polyglutamylated tubulin in NFT-bearing neurons. CONCLUSIONS Overall, we suggest that the specific changes in tubulin modification in AD brain likely represent a compensatory response.},

abstract = {The naturally occurring polyamine spermidine (Spd) has recently been shown to promote longevity across species in an autophagy-dependent manner. Here, we demonstrate that Spd improves both survival and locomotor activity of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster upon exposure to the superoxide generator and neurotoxic agent paraquat. Although survival to a high paraquat concentration (20 mM) was specifically increased in female flies only, locomotor activity and survival could be rescued in both male and female animals when exposed to lower paraquat levels (5 mM). These effects are dependent on the autophagic machinery, as Spd failed to confer resistance to paraquat-induced toxicity and locomotor impairment in flies deleted for the essential autophagic regulator ATG7 (autophagy-related gene 7). Spd treatment did also protect against mild doses of another oxidative stressor, hydrogen peroxide, but in this case in an autophagy-independent manner. Altogether, this study establishes that the protective effects of Spd can be exerted through different pathways that depending on the oxidative stress scenario do or do not involve autophagy.},

abstract = {Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is activated by various types of stress, including, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ER stress-induced ASK1 activation could play an important role both in neuronal apoptosis and an autophagic response in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease. The mechanism by which ASK1 executes apoptosis and/or autophagy under ER stress is still unclear. We have addressed this question using SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing wild-type (WT) ASK1. We show an important autophagic response and an acceleration of the paraquat (PQ)-induced autophagy with hallmarks as accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, activation of beclin-1, accumulation of LC3 II, p62 degradation, and mammalian target of rapamycin dephosphorylation. Inhibition of autophagy caused an exacerbation of the apoptosis induced by WT ASK1 overexpression with or without PQ. These data support the idea that the autophagic response could have a protector role. We found also an increase in the phosphorylation of the proteins such as IRE1 and eIF2$\alpha$ in response to both the overexpression of WT ASK1 and pesticide exposure. These data suggest that the WT ASK1 overexpression-induced autophagy is an event that occurs in parallel with ER stress activation. The importance of ER stress in the autophagy induced by ASK1 and/or PQ was confirmed with salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of eIF2$\alpha$ dephosphorylation. In conclusion, we report that PQ induces an early ER stress response that is correlated with the activation of autophagy as a protective response, which is accelerated in cells that overexpress WT ASK1. However, when the toxic stimuli remain, the cell eventually succumbs to apoptosis.},

These diseases are normally characterized by progressive loss of neuron cells and compromised motor or cognitive function. Previous studies have proposed that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may have complex roles in promoting the disease development. Research has shown that neuron cells are particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage due to their high polyunsaturated fatty acid content in membranes, high oxygen consumption, and weak antioxidant defense. However, the exact molecular pathogenesis of neurodegeneration related to the disturbance of redox balance remains unclear. Novel antioxidants have shown great potential in mediating disease phenotypes and could be an area of interest for further research. In this review, we provide an updated discussion on the roles of ROS in the pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinocerebellar ataxia, as well as a highlight on the antioxidant-based therapies for alleviating disease severity.},

Our findings indicated that the identification of autophagy-specific biomarkers for tissue is highly compromised due to lack of differential gene expression. In this respect, TEM remains an indispensable technique for evaluation of autophagy in situ. Nevertheless, immunohistochemical staining of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) appeared to be a valuable technique to detect autophagosome formation in tissue but only when this protein is overexpressed, e.g., in GFP-LC3 transgenic animals. Furthermore, demonstration of granular cytoplasmic ubiquitin inclusions by immunohistochemistry may be an attractive technique to measure autophagic cell degeneration in some human pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases, heart failure and atherosclerosis.},

We now report that lesions of rat hippocampal neurons cause a time-dependent, long-lasting elevation of immunoreactivity for the $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neighboring astrocytes, a cell type not normally containing the protein. The increase represents astroglial expression of the protein rather than a scavenging of APP released by damaged neurons. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that APP-containing cells are reactive astroglia, both surrounding capillaries and within the neuropil. These results demonstrate that neuronal damage stimulates APP expression in adult brain and suggest that reactive astrocytes may be a source of the $\beta$-amyloid that forms neuropathological plaques in Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

We found that: (1) the ratio between the enrichment of alanine C3 and that of glutamate C4, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) C2, glutamine C4, or aspartate C3 decreased from pentobarbital to alphachloralose and morphine whatever the labeled precursor, indicating a link between metabolic and cerebral activity; (2) under glucose + [3-(13)C]lactate infusion, alanine C3 and acetyl-CoA C2 enrichments were higher than that of lactate C3, revealing the occurrence of an isotopic dilution of the brain exogenous lactate (arising from the blood) by lactate from the brain (endogenous lactate), and that the latter was synthesized from glycolysis in a compartment other than neurons; and (3) the contribution of labeled glucose and lactate to acetyl-CoA and amino acid enrichment indicated that the involvement of blood glucose relative to that of blood lactate to brain metabolism was correlated with cerebral activity. The evolution of metabolite enrichments, however, indicated that the cerebral activity-dependent increase in the contribution of blood glucose relative to that of blood lactate to brain metabolism occurred partly via the increase in lactate metabolism generated from astrocytic glycolysis. These findings support the hypothesis for an astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle component in the coupling mechanism between cerebral activity and energy metabolism.},

abstract = {The cerebral cortex ensures an optimal interaction of mammals, including humans, with their environment, by encoding, storing and combining information about the surrounding world and the internal milieu. Probably the simplest and the most popular region for studying the cortical network is the hippocampal CA1 area, because it has the least heterogeneous neuronal population, the somata and dendrites of principal neurons (pyramidal cells) are arranged into well defined layers and the extrinsic and intrinsic inputs are segregated. The relatively homogeneous pyramidal cell population is supported by a very heterogeneous GABAergic interneuron population, which provides not only general inhibition, but also regulates the precise timing of pyramidal cell activity. Interneurons usually innervate distinct domains of the surface of their target cell. The strategic placement of inhibitory synapses, indicate that GABAergic interneurons belonging to different classes serve distinct functions in the hippocampal network. Neuron types are usually defined according to various morphological, molecular and physiological features. Under typical experimental conditions only some of these parameters are available, therefore an important scientific question is: which partial measures are sufficient for correct recognition of a class of cell. By immunohistochemistry it is possible to stain all neurochemically identical neurons in a given brain region, therefore it is the most widely used method for identifying neuron classes. This review presents the neuron types identified so far in the area CA1 of the rat hippocampus with special emphasis on the immunocytochemical characterization of these cells.},

abstract = {Autophagy failure is implicated in age-related human disease. A decrease in the rate of protein degradation through the entire autophagy pathway, i.e., autophagic flux, has been associated with the onset of cellular proteotoxity and cell death. Although the precision control of autophagy as a pharmacological intervention has received major attention, mammalian model systems that enable a dissection of the relationship between autophagic flux and pathway intermediate pool sizes remain largely underexplored. Here, we make use of a micropattern-based fluorescence life cell imaging approach, allowing a high degree of experimental control and cellular geometry constraints. By assessing two autophagy modulators in a system that achieves a similarly raised autophagic flux, we measure their impact on the pathway intermediate pool size, autophagosome velocity, and motion. Our results reveal a differential effect of autophagic flux enhancement on pathway intermediate pool sizes, velocities, and directionality of autophagosome motion, suggesting distinct control over autophagy function. These findings may be of importance for better understanding the fine-tuning autophagic activity and protein degradation proficiency in different cell and tissue types of age-associated pathologies.},

Although many papers have been published examining caspases in neuronal death and disease, the pathways have not been fully clarified. In the present review, we examine the potential players in the death pathways, the current tools for examining these players and the models for studying neurological disease.

For example, the role of various hormones and nutrient sensing pathways in life span extension may involve autophagy. Similarly, autophagy is the primary mechanism for removing damaged organelles, such as mitochondria, which may have a direct impact on aging.

abstract = {The development of treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently shifting away from the correction of neurotransmitter abnormalities and from attempts to remove the pathognomonic protein deposits. Drug discovery is heading towards novel types of pharmacological interventions which are aimed at more central and upstream pathophysiological events. The large number of upcoming treatment targets can be grouped into two major categories. The first category consists of antecedents of beta amyloid peptide (A$\beta$) and TAU deposition including A$\beta$ production, degradation and clearance, TAU hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. The second consists of protectors against neuronal dysfunction and premature death such as mitochondrial functioning, nerve growth and regeneration, and neuronal membrane integrity. It is hoped that some of these strategies will not only have larger symptomatic effects than the currently available drugs but also an impact on the underlying neurodegeneration. Since the novel treatments will be typically administered over years they must meet high standards of safety, drug-drug compatibility, and tolerability. Probably the most important target groups for novel treatments are carriers of mutations causing AD, and individuals with minor cognitive impairment representing a pre-dementia stage of the disease. To minimise incorrect case identifications, drug development must be paralleled by improved diagnostic techniques. Novel pharmacological strategies may be cost-effective if disability and need of full-time care can be postponed or prevented without prolonging time lived with dementia or extending survival. We are uncertain whether the advent of novel disease-retarding strategies will revolutionise the management of AD. Symptomatic treatments will continue to be needed, and psychosocial approaches will retain an essential role in supporting affected individuals and their families. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The D-R cell subline, an ornithine decarboxylase-overproducing variant of L1210 mouse leukemia cells, shows a growth advantage at low osmolality due to its high putrescine content. We tested the ability of spermidine to fulfill the role of putrescine under hyposmotic conditions. Although spermidine (1- 30 ?M) had no effect on growth under normosmotic conditions (325 mosm/kg), it was strongly inhibitory to D-R cell proliferation at 150 mosm/kg in a concentration-dependent manner. Hypotonic shock greatly increased the rate of spermidine uptake in D-R cells. The increased spermidine content enhanced total putrescine synthesis through a large induction of cytosolic spermidine/spermine N 1-acetyltransferase activity but also promoted the excretion of most of the putrescine synthesized by the cells. Delaying the addition of spermidine until 24 h after hypotonic shock resulted in a much sharper decrease in D-R cell viability and strongly depressed polyamine contents. These lethal effects occurred between 8 and 24 h after spermidine addition and followed a dramatic increase in the rate and extent of spermidine accumulation which overrode the metabolic capacity of the N 1- acetyltransferase/polyamine oxidase (PAO) pathway. Inhibition of PAO partly reversed the effect of spermidine on growth when the polyamine was added at the time of hypotonic shock, but not 24 h later. Similar experiments performed with ?-methylspermidine, a metabolically resistant analog, which can completely fulfill cellular requirements for spermidine in normosmotic media, suggested that the lethal effect of a delayed spermidine addition is caused predominantly by excessive accumulation with a minor contribution resulting from stress due to polyamine oxidase activity. In contrast, in hypotonically shocked L1210 cells, spermidine stimulated cell proliferation (albeit less effectively than putrescine), there was no lethal effect of a delayed addition of ?-methylspermidine, and there was no time-dependent increase in the rate of ?-methylspermidine uptake. Thus, the spermidine transport system is strongly enhanced by hyposmotic shock in D-R cells, which can result in extensive cell death from overaccumulation of the polyamine and, to a lesser extent, from stress related to the PAO-catalyzed degradation of N 1-acetylspermidine. The absence of these effects in parental L1210 cells indicates that the acquisition of an ornithine decarboxylase-overproducing phenotype also involves major modifications in the expression and/or regulation of polyamine transport.},

To assess the therapeutic potential of spermidine in mice with excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) deletion (EAAC1 knockout [KO] mice), a mouse model of normal tension glaucoma. METHODS. Spermidine, at 30 mM in drinking water, was administered to EAAC1 KO mice from 5 to 12 weeks old. Optical coherence tomography, multifocal electroretinograms, and the measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) were performed at 5, 8, and 12 weeks old. Histopathology analyses were carried out at 8 and 12 weeks old, and immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) in the retina were performed at 8 weeks old. RESULTS. Spermidine ameliorated retinal degeneration and improved visual function in EAAC1 KO mice at both 8 and 12 weeks old, without affecting IOP. A significant increase of 4-HNE was observed in vehicle-treated EAAC1 KO mice, but spermidine treatment reduced this increase, suggesting that spermidine alleviated the severity of the glaucoma-like phenotype by acting as an antioxidant. CONCLUSIONS. The results from this study suggest that oral spermidine administration could be a useful treatment for retinal degenerative disorders including glaucoma.},

abstract = {Autolysosomal dysfunction and unstable microtubules are hallmarks of chronic neurodegenerative diseases associated with misfolded proteins. Investigation of impaired protein quality control and clearance systems could therefore provide an important avenue for intervention. To investigate this we have used a highly controlled model for protein aggregation, an in vitro prion system. Here we report that prion aggregates traffic via autolysosomes in the cytoplasm. Treatment with the natural polyamine spermine clears aggregates by enhancing autolysosomal flux. We demonstrated this by blocking the formation of mature autophagosomes resulting in accumulation of prion aggregates in the cytoplasm. Further we investigated the mechanism of spermine's mode of action and we demonstrate that spermine increases the acetylation of microtubules, which is known to facilitate retrograde transport of autophagosomes from the cellular periphery to lysosomes located near the nucleus. We further report that spermine facilitates selective autophagic degradation of prion aggregates by binding to microtubule protein Tubb6.

abstract = {Mitochondria play critical roles in neuronal function and almost all aspects of mitochondrial function are altered in Alzheimer neurons. Emerging evidence shows that mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo continuous fission and fusion, the balance of which not only controls mitochondrial morphology and number, but also regulates mitochondrial function and distribution. In this review, after a brief overview of the basic mechanisms involved in the regulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion and how mitochondrial dynamics affects mitochondrial function, we will discuss in detail our and others' recent work demonstrating abnormal mitochondrial morphology and distribution in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models and how these abnormalities may contribute to mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction in AD. We propose that abnormal mitochondrial dynamics plays a key role in causing the dy sfunction of mitochondria that ultimately damage AD neurons. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Society for Neurochemistry.},

abstract = {AIM To determine whether the serum level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an important indicator of neuron damage, correlates with the extent of tissue damage in the rat with induced head trauma and to obtain data in order to avoid unnecessary cranial computed tomography analyses. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Rats were divided into 5 groups. The experimental head trauma model was examined in five groups (n=8) as follows: The control group had no intervention; Group 1: Head trauma was induced by dropping a 25 mg ball from a height of 20 cm; Group 2: Head trauma was induced by dropping a 50 mg ball from a height of 20 cm; Group 3: Head trauma was induced by dropping a 50 mg ball from a height of 80 cm; Group 4: Head trauma was induced by dropping a 100 mg ball from a height of 80 cm. Thus, according to the Newton's Law, respectively 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 N trauma was created. Serum GFAP levels were analyzed and the damage to cerebral tissues was evaluated in all groups. RESULTS We determined that number of apoptotic cells and particularly the number of GFAP (+) protoplasmic astrocytes at the perilesional region of the cortex increased in association with the increased serum GFAP level as long as the severity of the trauma increased. CONCLUSION Serum GFAP concentration can be used as a marker of the severity of head trauma and traumatic brain injury. However, more animal studies are required to reflect this result in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Phagocytosis controls CNS homeostasis by facilitating the removal of unwanted cellular debris. Accordingly, impairments in different receptors or proteins involved in phagocytosis result in enhanced inflammation and neurodegeneration. While various studies have identified extrinsic factors that modulate phagocytosis in health and disease, key intracellular regulators are less understood. Here we show that the autophagy protein beclin 1 is required for efficient phagocytosis in vitro and in mouse brains. Furthermore, we show that beclin 1-mediated impairments in phagocytosis are associated with dysfunctional recruitment of retromer to phagosomal membranes, reduced retromer levels, and impaired recycling of phagocytic receptors CD36 and Trem2. Interestingly, microglia isolated from human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains show significantly reduced beclin 1 and retromer protein levels. These findings position beclin 1 as a link between autophagy, retromer trafficking, and receptor-mediated phagocytosis and provide insight into mechanisms by which phagocytosis is regulated and how it may become impaired in AD.},

Indeed, aging promotes the structural and functional declines of both the heart and the blood circulation system. In this review, we revise the contribution of known longevity pathways to cardiovascular health and delineate the possibilities to interfere with them. In particular, we evaluate autophagy, the intracellular catabolic recycling system associated with life- and health-span extension. We present genetic models, pharmacological interventions, and dietary strategies that block, reduce, or enhance autophagy upon age-related cardiovascular deterioration. Caloric restriction or caloric restriction mimetics like metformin, spermidine, and rapamycin (all of which trigger autophagy) are among the most promising cardioprotective interventions during aging. We conclude that autophagy is a fundamental process to ensure cardiac and vascular health during aging and outline its putative therapeutic importance.},

abstract = {Protein degradation by basal constitutive autophagy is important to avoid accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein aggregates and development of neurodegenerative diseases. The polyubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1 is degraded by autophagy. It is found in cellular inclusion bodies together with polyubiquitinated proteins and in cytosolic protein aggregates that accumulate in various chronic, toxic, and degenerative diseases. Here we show for the first time a direct interaction between p62 and the autophagic effector proteins LC3A and -B and the related gamma-aminobutyrate receptor-associated protein and gamma-aminobutyrate receptor-associated-like proteins. The binding is mediated by a 22-residue sequence of p62 containing an evolutionarily conserved motif. To monitor the autophagic sequestration of p62- and LC3-positive bodies, we developed a novel pH-sensitive fluorescent tag consisting of a tandem fusion of the red, acid-insensitive mCherry and the acid-sensitive green fluorescent proteins. This approach revealed that p62- and LC3-positive bodies are degraded in autolysosomes. Strikingly, even rather large p62-positive inclusion bodies (2 microm diameter) become degraded by autophagy. The specific interaction between p62 and LC3, requiring the motif we have mapped, is instrumental in mediating autophagic degradation of the p62-positive bodies. We also demonstrate that the previously reported aggresome-like induced structures containing ubiquitinated proteins in cytosolic bodies are dependent on p62 for their formation. In fact, p62 bodies and these structures are indistinguishable. Taken together, our results clearly suggest that p62 is required both for the formation and the degradation of polyubiquitin-containing bodies by autophagy.},

@article{Casarejos2011,
abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and others are due to accumulation of abnormal proteins which fold improperly and impair neuronal function. Accumulation of these proteins could be achieved by several mechanisms including mutation, overproduction or impairment of its degradation. Inhibition of the normal protein degradation is produced by blockade of the ubiquitin proteasome system. We have shown that epoxomicin, a proteasome inhibitor, increases the levels of proteins involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as ??-synuclein and hyper phosphorylated tau in NB69 human neuroblastoma cells and that such increase correlates with an enhanced rate of cell death. We then investigated whether the stimulation of autophagy, an alternative mechanism for elimination of abnormal proteins, by treatment with trehalose, counteracts the effects of proteasomal blockade. Trehalose, a disaccharide present in many non-mammalian species, known to enhance autophagy, protects cells against various environmental stresses. Treatment with trehalose produced a dose and time-dependent increase in the number of autophagosomes and markers of autophagy in NB69 cells. Trehalose did not change the number of total neither the number of dividing cells in the culture but it completely prevented the necrosis of NB69 induced by epoxomicin. In addition, the treatment with trehalose reverted the accumulation, induced by epoxomicin, of polyubiquitinated proteins, total and phosphorylated tau, p-GSK-3, and ??-synuclein, as well as the ??-synuclein intracellular aggregates. The effects of trehalose were not mediated through activation of free radical scavenging compounds, like GSH, or mitochondrial proteins, like DJ1, but trehalose reduced the activation of ERK and chaperone HSP-70 induced by epoxomicin. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation prevented the epoxomicin-induced cell death. Inhibition of autophagy reverted the neuroprotective effects of trehalose in epoxomicin-induced cell death. These results suggest that trehalose is a powerful modifier of abnormal protein accumulation in neurodegenerative diseases. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) is an earlyonset form of Parkinson's disease characterized by motor disturbances and dopaminergic neurodegeneration(1,2). To address its underlyingmolecular pathogenesis, we generated and characterized loss-of-function mutants of Drosophila PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)(3), a novel AR-JP-linked gene(4). Here, we show that PINK1 mutants exhibit indirect flight muscle and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration accompanied by locomotive defects. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy analysis and a rescue experiment with Drosophila Bcl-2 demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction accounts for the degenerative changes in all phenotypes of PINK1 mutants. Notably, we also found that PINK1 mutants share marked phenotypic similarities with parkin mutants. Transgenic expression of Parkin markedly ameliorated all PINK1 loss-of-function phenotypes, but not vice versa, suggesting that Parkin functions downstream of PINK1. Taken together, our genetic evidence clearly establishes that Parkin and PINK1 act in a common pathway in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function in both muscles and dopaminergic neurons.},

abstract = {Inactivation of constitutive autophagy results in formation of cytoplasmic protein inclusions and leads to liver injury and neurodegeneration, but the details of abnormalities related to impaired autophagy are largely unknown. Here we used mouse genetic analyses to define the roles of autophagy in the aforementioned events. We report that the ubiquitin- and LC3-binding protein "p62" regulates the formation of protein aggregates and is removed by autophagy. Thus, genetic ablation of p62 suppressed the appearance of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates in hepatocytes and neurons, indicating that p62 plays an important role in inclusion body formation. Moreover, loss of p62 markedly attenuated liver injury caused by autophagy deficiency, whereas it had little effect on neuronal degeneration. Our findings highlight the unexpected role of homeostatic level of p62, which is regulated by autophagy, in controlling intracellular inclusion body formation, and indicate that the pathologic process associated with autophagic deficiency is cell-type specific.},

abstract = {A major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is aging. Two processes that have been implicated in aging are free radical-induced oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. A progressive impairment of mitochondrial function and/or increased oxidative damage has been suggested to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative diseases. For example, decreased complex I activity, increased oxidative damage and altered activities of antioxidant defense enzymes have been demonstrated in PD. In AD, decrements in complex IV activity and increased oxidative damage have been reported. Reductions in complex II activity, increased cortical lactate levels and oxidative damage have been described in HD. Some familial ALS cases are associated with mutations in the gene for Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) while increased oxidative damage is observed in sporadic ALS. Studies in PSP have demonstrated regionally specific reductions in brain and muscle mitochondrial function, hypofrontality and increased oxidative damage. Altogether, the age-dependent onset and progressive course of these neurodegenerative diseases may ultimately highlight an association between aging, mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress.},

abstract = {The amyloid hypothesis, which has been the predominant framework for research in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been the source of considerable controversy. The amyloid hypothesis postulates that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the causative agent in AD. It is strongly supported by data from rare autosomal dominant forms of AD. However, the evidence that Abeta causes or contributes to age-associated sporadic AD is more complex and less clear, prompting criticism of the hypothesis. We provide an overview of the major arguments for and against the amyloid hypothesis. We conclude that Abeta likely is the key initiator of a complex pathogenic cascade that causes AD. However, we argue that Abeta acts primarily as a trigger of other downstream processes, particularly tau aggregation, which mediate neurodegeneration. Abeta appears to be necessary, but not sufficient, to cause AD. Its major pathogenic effects may occur very early in the disease process.},
